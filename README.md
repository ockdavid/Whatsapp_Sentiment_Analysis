## I - Introduction

**Messaging apps like WhatsApp** have made communication easier and more accessible. However, analyzing the vast **amount of data** generated by these apps can be **challenging**. **Sentiment analysis** can help by categorizing opinions expressed in text and **understanding how people feel** about a product, service, or brand.

*That's where sentiment analysis comes in.* Sentiment analysis is a **technique** used to analyze and categorize opinions expressed in a piece of text. It's commonly used in social media monitoring, market research, and customer service to understand how people feel about a product, service, or brand.

In this project, we applied sentiment analysis to a WhatsApp group chat. We exported the chat to a text file and used **natural language processing** techniques to analyze the sentiments expressed in the messages. Our goal was to understand the overall sentiment of the conversation, as well as the sentiment of each person included in the chat.

The **purpose** of this repository is to demonstrate the potential of sentiment analysis in understanding the sentiment of messages on group chats and can be applied to any WhatsApp chat to gain insights into **people's feelings** about a particular topic or conversation. However, as our findings indicate, **sentiment analysis models are not perfect** and may require further refinement to increase their accuracy.

This repository provides the **whole code** that works perfectly, **comments** to understand it, and the **model trained** to evaluate any whatsapp chat.

## III - Folder structure

The structure of this project.

- `/Chats`: Whatsapp file exported
- `/NLP Datacamp`: Resources 
- `/Screenshots`: Images to show on Readme
- `/Drafts`: Some notebook drafts before the main code 

## IV - Conventions, templates and labels

### A - Commit conventions

```
tag(scope): #issue_id - message
```

See [COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md](assets/docs/COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md) for more informations.

### B - Branch naming convention

```
type_scope-of-the-work
```

See [BRANCH_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md](assets/docs/BRANCH_NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md) for more informations.

### C - Issue template

See [user-story.md](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md) for more informations.

### D - Pull request template

See [pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md) for more informations.

### E - Custom issues labels preset

The labels preset is located at [.github/settings.yml](.github/settings.yml).

You can **add, edit or remove** them. To automatically update these labels, you need to **install** the ["Settings" GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/settings), which will **syncs repository settings defined in the file above to your repository**.

## V - CI/CD, release and container registry

### A - CI

[![GO](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/ci.go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/ci.go.yml)

The **CI** workflow is located at [.github/workflows/ci.go.yml](.github/workflows/ci.go.yml). It's triggered a **each push** on **all branches**.

It consist of:

- **install Golang** on the VM
- get the dependancies **using the cache of other Actions run**
- **lint the files** to check or syntax errors
- **build** the application

### B - CD

[![DOCKER](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/cd.docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/cd.docker.yml)

The **CD** workflow is located at [.github/workflows/cd.docker.yml](.github/workflows/cd.docker.yml). It's triggered a **each push** on **`main` branch**.

It consist of:

- **login** into the GitHub container registry (ghcr.io)
- **build and push** the Golang api using the **production Dockerfile** located at [build/pakage/sample-api/Dockerfile](build/pakage/sample-api/Dockerfile)

After that, you can check the **pushed container** at: `https://github.com/<username>?tab=packages&repo_name=<repository-name>`

> IMPORTANT: you need to **update the production Dockerfile** with your **username** AND **_repository name_**. Otherwise, there will be errors at push:

```bash
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source = "https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>"
```

### C - Release

[![RELEASE](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/md.release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/md.release.yml)

The **release** workflow is located at [.github/workflows/md.release.yml](.github/workflows/md.release.yml). It's triggered **manually by user input** at: [Actions > RELEASE](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/md.release.yml).

> IMPORTANT: you need to set the **image tag** in the action input, for the action to be able to push the docker image and create a release **with a specific version**. The image tag is a [SemVer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning) tag, e.g. `1.0.2`.

It consist of:

- check if the **environment match the branch**
- do the CD (docker) action again, but **with a specific image tag**
- create a release **with the same tag**, filled with the **generated changelog as closed issues since the last release**

After that, you can check the release at `https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>/releases`.

### D - Labeler

[![LABELER](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/ci.labeler.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gogolcorp/go-yave/actions/workflows/ci.labeler.yml)

The **labeler** workflow consists in **assigning specific labels** on **pull requests** according to the files that have been modified in the **commits attached to this pull request**.


## VI - Project setup

The project use **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to build and run local and distant images in our workspace.

### A - Stack

All the images use the **same network**, more informations at [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

| CONTAINER | PORT        | IMAGE                                                                    |
| :-------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GOLANG    | `3333:3333` | [build/pakage/sample-api/Dockerfile](build/pakage/sample-api/Dockerfile) |
| ADMINER   | `3334:8080` | [build/package/adminer/Dockerfile](build/package/adminer/Dockerfile)     |
| POSTGRES  | `5432:5432` | [postgres:latest](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)                     |

> Adminer is a GUI that allows us to **manage your database** by permetting to to **create, edit, delete** the different entities, tables, etc.
