10/11/22, 16:54 - david: Can you ask if the club is gonna be open tomorrow?
10/11/22, 18:40 - david: I just talked with Sergio, he said 2 things:

1. Statistical Foundations and Artificial Intelligence are the most "academic courses". It means they're like a university course because of its content. BUT the subjects that we see in statistics we we'll see them again in others courses, so don't worry if you didn't understand everything the first day. We will see the subjects again.

2. The first day of the project course on November 29th (he said the date will change maybe) we will see the past projects, how we're going to  work, we're going to set up the groups, etc. So don't worry about it and just enjoy the city.
10/11/22, 18:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Thanks!!!

10/20/22, 16:58 - Gabriel Rennó: yeah i noticed it too
10/20/22, 16:58 - Gabriel Rennó: I just pointed out to him with comments in the code
10/20/22, 17:00 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Same
10/20/22, 17:01 - Ottavio Oludovisi: It took me a total of 9 hours to do the assignment
10/20/22, 17:01 - Ottavio Oludovisi: 🙃
10/20/22, 17:05 - Ruben Tak: :,)
10/20/22, 17:05 - Ruben Tak: I’m in Spain but the s is silent..
10/20/22, 17:13 - Onassis Nottage: Kml
10/20/22, 17:13 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
10/20/22, 17:26 - Ottavio Oludovisi: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 17:29 - Ruben Tak: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 19:41 - Gabriel Rennó: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 19:42 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
10/20/22, 19:44 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ahahahahhaha
10/20/22, 21:34 - david: *-Which is the mean alcohol consumption per continent for every column entry? -*
This is asking for total_litres_of_pure_alcohol? Or the mean of all the columns?
10/20/22, 21:35 - Onassis Nottage: I used the total litres column
10/20/22, 21:35 - david: I think that column is the result of the 3 columns that are next to it, right?
10/20/22, 21:35 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I don’t know he asks for every column entry
10/20/22, 21:36 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I outputted all columns
10/20/22, 21:36 - Ottavio Oludovisi: To me it seemed he asked for all of em
10/20/22, 21:36 - david: Yea, that confuses me
10/20/22, 21:38 - Onassis Nottage: How much points is this?
10/20/22, 21:38 - david: 10
10/20/22, 21:39 - Ottavio Oludovisi: In a way yes but since it’s not a direct sum I wouldn’t say it’s the same thing to only use that
10/20/22, 21:39 - Onassis Nottage: 😪
10/20/22, 21:39 - david: I'll write both answers
10/20/22, 21:40 - Onassis Nottage: Let me take a look at this
10/20/22, 21:40 - Onassis Nottage: Right
10/20/22, 22:03 - Onassis Nottage: And for the brave ones:
10/20/22, 22:03 - Onassis Nottage: Is that a bonus?
10/20/22, 22:03 - david: Nope
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: Why'd he label it like it was?
10/20/22, 22:04 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Because you actually need to be brave
10/20/22, 22:04 - Ottavio Oludovisi: At least I had to
10/20/22, 22:04 - Ottavio Oludovisi: 🥲
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: I really didn't want to look back a the other questions
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: I solved it
10/20/22, 22:04 - david: Because if you can't do it you should feel bad because you are not a brave one
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: So I didn't really care if this was right or wrong
10/20/22, 22:04 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:05 - Onassis Nottage: I'm aware of the points lol, but are the points optional is what I'm asking
10/20/22, 22:05 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Honestly if he counts it as wrong I’ll say that it wasn’t very clear
10/20/22, 22:05 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, I'm not interested in this homework anymore
10/20/22, 22:05 - Onassis Nottage: I've looked at this too much
10/20/22, 22:05 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I mean it won’t change much, I don’t think grades matter a lot but still
10/20/22, 22:05 - david: The sum is 100 points including the last part
10/20/22, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: I answered everything lol, I'm just don't believe we need to overthink what he's asking
10/20/22, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: The instructions should've been more clearer
10/20/22, 22:07 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I agree, we all could go back but meh
10/20/22, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: Lol I appreciate you
10/20/22, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: I know exactly how you feel about this
10/20/22, 22:07 - david: Don't worry, it's only 30%
10/20/22, 22:07 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:07 - david: 40*%
10/20/22, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: Didn't this change?
10/20/22, 22:08 - david: Waaaait
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: He kept talking about it in class
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: I can't remember what each one is now though
10/20/22, 22:08 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: There we go
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: That's it
10/20/22, 22:08 - david: I think that's the right one
10/20/22, 22:09 - david: 🫠
10/20/22, 22:09 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaoo
10/20/22, 22:09 - Onassis Nottage: "C's get degrees"
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: Ohhhh
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: Wait
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: @393663863107 if it's out of 100
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: We could still not give a shit about that question
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: Because it's 90% if everything else is right
10/20/22, 22:35 - Onassis Nottage: Including total liters of pure alcohol?
10/20/22, 22:39 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yep
10/20/22, 22:39 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yes i just dont think its smart to give confusing instruction to people that have to face problems they never encountered before
10/20/22, 22:39 - Onassis Nottage: Alright
10/20/22, 22:40 - Onassis Nottage: "That's the life of a data scientist"
10/20/22, 22:40 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I mean i know its not what he wanted to do
10/20/22, 22:40 - Onassis Nottage: I'm sure that would be a response
10/20/22, 22:40 - Ottavio Oludovisi: One would think
10/20/22, 22:40 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, I think we should petition that one to be a bonus, because it's really confusing
10/20/22, 22:41 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I woul send him an email but im too tired, maybe ill send one tomomrrow
10/20/22, 22:41 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:42 - david: I'm more confuse than one hour ago
10/20/22, 22:42 - Onassis Nottage: We have no idea
10/20/22, 22:42 - Onassis Nottage: I wrote multiple answers
10/20/22, 22:42 - david: Just in case
10/20/22, 22:42 - david: I'll do it now, maybe tomorrow is answering
10/20/22, 22:43 - Onassis Nottage: I grouped by continent, aggregated by mean, and sorted the values in one answer
10/20/22, 22:43 - Onassis Nottage: Then I made an entirely new column that has the average of each row for another answer
10/20/22, 23:23 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 23:24 - Onassis Nottage: I thought it was because of my laptop screen, but I'm on a monitor now and it's showing the same thing
10/20/22, 23:24 - david: After 3-4 hours I couldnt but Miguel told me that it doesn't matter
10/20/22, 23:25 - Onassis Nottage: Say less, thanks
10/20/22, 23:25 - Onassis Nottage: I guess I'm officially done with this
10/20/22, 23:32 - Onassis Nottage: Just turned mine in
10/20/22, 23:33 - Onassis Nottage: I'm heading to bed
10/21/22, 11:44 - Gabriel Rennó: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 18:13 - Onassis Nottage: Anyone out now?
10/21/22, 18:13 - Onassis Nottage: Or want to go out before this thing at 9?
10/21/22, 18:14 - Joseph: I'd be down to drink a beer in a park/beach or something more casual
10/21/22, 18:14 - Onassis Nottage: Let’s do it!
10/21/22, 18:14 - Onassis Nottage: Pregame
10/21/22, 18:14 - Joseph: Warm-up

10/21/22, 18:15 - david: Wanna go to this place?
10/21/22, 18:15 - david: La Pecera del Pool

10/21/22, 18:15 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure what you sent but I’m down lol
10/21/22, 18:15 - Onassis Nottage: We can meet there if you want
10/21/22, 18:16 - Onassis Nottage: It’ll take me 30 minutes to get there, @4915750950176 you want to go?
10/21/22, 18:17 - david: I'm be there in 30-40 min
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: Just wanted to confirm before I leave since it takes a while for me to get there
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: Cool
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: @995555481144 see you there bro!
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: First round is on me
10/21/22, 18:18 - Onassis Nottage: Unless you’re somewhere else? 👀
10/21/22, 18:18 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah I will be there at around 9
10/21/22, 18:18 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: We can continue somewhere after this ! 🤟
10/21/22, 18:19 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Do you plan at Nevermind Bar?
10/21/22, 18:20 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I am finishing DS assignment 😬
10/21/22, 18:21 - Joseph: Probably see you at nevermind at 930~
10/21/22, 18:21 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah I’ll be there
10/21/22, 18:21 - Onassis Nottage: Alright
10/21/22, 18:22 - Onassis Nottage: I just finished everything else and don’t have anything to do till then lol
10/21/22, 18:22 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Okay then see you there !
10/21/22, 18:25 - david: Damn, I forgot to send it 😂
10/21/22, 18:25 - david: I was busy with the documents and the TIE appointment
10/21/22, 18:25 - david: Finally I'm done with that
10/21/22, 18:27 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I think last one is also incorrect
10/21/22, 18:28 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Cause there are countries with 0-s in wine beer and spirit and in PIE chart it is as Beer, I think it must be None
10/21/22, 18:29 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
10/21/22, 18:30 - david: With my solution I got the same result as the professor
10/21/22, 18:30 - david: 🫡
10/21/22, 18:30 - Onassis Nottage: You have to set those to np.nan when that’s the case
10/21/22, 18:33 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yeah just add a second condition to every function line that states the value must be >0
10/21/22, 18:34 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah but if I put them as Nan thr result will be like this
10/21/22, 18:35 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: beer 101, spirit 59, Wine 20 and None 13
10/21/22, 18:35 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Professor says Beer 114
10/21/22, 18:35 - Onassis Nottage: No, np.nan
10/21/22, 18:35 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Because he counted beers when it NaN
10/21/22, 18:35 - Onassis Nottage: When you set it to this, the plot doesn’t include null values
10/21/22, 18:37 - Onassis Nottage: @34695128762 should I leave now?
10/21/22, 18:42 - david: I'll be there in 30
10/21/22, 18:42 - david: I'm just checking the hw before submitte it
10/21/22, 18:56 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: You are going to the pool right? And after this at nevermind?
10/21/22, 18:57 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
10/21/22, 19:03 - Onassis Nottage: I wanted to pregame before the party
10/21/22, 19:03 - Onassis Nottage: Because I have to be up pretty early tomorrow
10/21/22, 19:06 - david: To study the whole day
10/21/22, 19:06 - Onassis Nottage: Nah, that was today
10/21/22, 19:06 - Onassis Nottage: Last week Friday our teacher decided to have class
10/21/22, 19:06 - Onassis Nottage: So Saturday became study day
10/21/22, 19:07 - Gabriel Rennó: Are you guys going to the bar that the ppl said in the group?
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: This is the location
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: If you want to come
10/21/22, 19:13 - david: To nevermind? I'll go
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: Oh that, yeah I’m going after this
10/21/22, 19:18 - david: Did you get to the bar?
10/21/22, 19:18 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
10/21/22, 19:19 - david: I'll be there in a second

10/22/22, 01:19 - david: Not me bro
10/22/22, 01:19 - david: Amos told me you left
10/22/22, 01:19 - Onassis Nottage: Oh, I didn’t see you at all lol, I thought you left
10/22/22, 01:29 - david: Not bro I'm still here

10/22/22, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah it was really informative and lively
10/22/22, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: They had booths of different companies that were in either tourism, education or immigration categories
10/22/22, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: I networked with a lady that used artists NFTs in augmented reality throughout Barcelona
10/22/22, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: Basically artists create virtual art, and you can explore through the areas looking for them
10/22/22, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: Almost like Pokémon Go, but with art
10/22/22, 13:02 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah I have heard of it, there are like digital artist shows where you just by ticket online and review the paintings in  digital space - so the world is really going digital in many parts
10/22/22, 13:02 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I think if you told the man 20 years ago that he can review paintings with VR in digital, he will take you as mad 😀
10/22/22, 13:03 - Onassis Nottage: Yes, it’s really cool
10/22/22, 13:03 - Onassis Nottage: 😂😂😂 exactly
10/22/22, 16:10 - Joseph: Is anyone still going?

11/3/22, 15:42 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Hey guys, I had changed the dtype through the modify table menu in sqlite, but while trying to do the same by coding I can’t seem to make it work
11/3/22, 15:43 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_cast.asp
11/3/22, 15:44 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I’m using this exact syntax but it doesn’t seem to work
11/3/22, 15:45 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: ,CAST("altitude" AS INT) as airport_altitude
11/3/22, 15:45 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: this one works
11/3/22, 15:51 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Still something broken
11/3/22, 15:52 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Can you share the code ?
11/3/22, 15:54 - Ottavio Oludovisi: <Media omitted>
11/3/22, 15:54 - Ottavio Oludovisi: i tried with "altitude" too but it fill the column with 0s
11/3/22, 15:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Its just easier to change the dtype through the menu but im guesing thats not what he wants
11/3/22, 17:00 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Once again, so @12428076373  what do you think ?
11/3/22, 17:01 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I  can do it as well - but as I said before my vote is for Onassis.
11/3/22, 17:01 - Joseph: I think is fine

11/4/22, 10:12 - Onassis Nottage: Let me hear your thoughts, if you started?
11/4/22, 10:13 - Onassis Nottage: If the file isn't in the list of names he sent, I just let it send a note to say it's not in the list and will call it a day...
11/4/22, 10:14 - david: Not yet
11/4/22, 10:14 - david: But this is good
11/4/22, 10:14 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Honestly i still dont have a clue how to properly write .py files, i sent him a mail asking where i can study for it couse i cant seem to find a proper tutorial
11/4/22, 10:14 - Ottavio Oludovisi: But ofc he didnt answer
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: I just copy everything I did in the notebook and put it in the file
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: I test it out with input()
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: And then replace input with sys.argv[1]
11/4/22, 10:15 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I dont think thats fair, tahnks a lot tho
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: So it'll work in the shell
11/4/22, 10:15 - david: Are you using jupyter notebook?
11/4/22, 10:16 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Im trying to run it in the terminal, but the point i cant get across is the logic of the code itself
11/4/22, 10:17 - david: You can write your code on a notepad and save it with the .py like file.py and it is a py file
11/4/22, 10:17 - david: And what you write there is the same as a notebook
11/4/22, 10:18 - david: I can explain you after the My digital impact

11/4/22, 10:27 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Im the last person who can help you out i fear
11/4/22, 10:44 - Onassis Nottage: It's because of the path to your file
11/4/22, 10:44 - Onassis Nottage: This time we're not using an actual path, so you have to move to the directory of your py file
11/4/22, 10:45 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
11/4/22, 10:45 - Joseph: So it's "okay"
11/4/22, 10:45 - david: Looks like create_db it's not a python file
11/4/22, 10:46 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
11/4/22, 10:50 - Onassis Nottage: Alright, I'm just going to turn this in before I forget..

11/7/22, 16:26 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
11/7/22, 16:39 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ahahahaaha
11/7/22, 16:52 - Joseph: What is the probability that we will get more last minute notice from stadistics?
11/7/22, 16:52 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Lets plot it
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: We have like 3 more classes left
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: And only what? Two were in person? Lol
11/7/22, 16:53 - Joseph: do you know if Ankit is teaching any other courses?
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: So far
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: Big data something
11/7/22, 16:54 - Joseph: fuck
11/7/22, 16:54 - Onassis Nottage: Or advanced data science?
11/7/22, 16:54 - Onassis Nottage: One of the two
11/7/22, 16:54 - Joseph: can we request a another teacher?
11/7/22, 16:54 - Ruben Tak: @ class representative
11/7/22, 16:55 - Joseph: I mean, I guess we can, but Idk if I am the only one that would want that
11/7/22, 16:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Harsh but I agree
11/7/22, 16:55 - Onassis Nottage: If the majority wants a new one, I’ll march in the streets till we do
11/7/22, 16:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: 🎉
11/7/22, 16:56 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I think he’s super nice, I just don’t think we learned much yet and his method seems a bit off to me
11/7/22, 16:56 - Joseph: i would talk with Daria to see what are the options, i am not happy with the class itself and even less with so many remote/missing clases
11/7/22, 16:56 - Joseph: i mean, he is nice, I like him, he would be my friend, but idk if my teacher
11/7/22, 16:57 - Onassis Nottage: I agree
11/7/22, 16:57 - Gabriel Rennó: maybe we can suggest them to hire a teacher who actually teaches
11/7/22, 16:57 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Savage
11/7/22, 16:57 - Onassis Nottage: Lol
11/7/22, 16:58 - Joseph: agree
11/7/22, 16:58 - Onassis Nottage: I just don’t see much of a correlation between what he teaches and what we should know/ be prepared for in the real world
11/7/22, 16:59 - Onassis Nottage: I studied math myself and no job is going to ask me to find a hypergeometric distribution
11/7/22, 16:59 - Onassis Nottage: At least not the ones I worked for
11/7/22, 16:59 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Was about to say you have a degree in mathematics
11/7/22, 16:59 - Onassis Nottage: No case studies, or anything
11/7/22, 16:59 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Which I think strengthens the statement
11/7/22, 16:59 - david: Same here
11/7/22, 17:00 - Onassis Nottage: I get what he’s trying to do, but there’s no way to accomplish that in this short timeframe with this diverse group
11/7/22, 17:00 - Onassis Nottage: The best solution is case studies to see where to apply different things
11/7/22, 17:01 - david: He's just following the idea of the course: "statistics"
11/7/22, 17:02 - Gabriel Rennó: I mean, i feel like i didnt learn *anything* from this class
11/7/22, 17:02 - Ruben Tak: A man of the people 🤝
11/7/22, 17:02 - Ottavio Oludovisi: He said: “try and apply these concepts to databases you find”
Yeah ok
11/7/22, 17:02 - Gabriel Rennó: And we are paying for that
11/7/22, 17:02 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaooooo
11/7/22, 17:03 - Gabriel Rennó: So it kind of sucks
11/7/22, 17:03 - Onassis Nottage: We can do this if you want?
11/7/22, 17:03 - Onassis Nottage: I can find something on Kaggle
11/7/22, 17:03 - david: Because we don't learn like Hindus do
11/7/22, 17:03 - Onassis Nottage: But I just figured no one would’ve cared about that extra assignment
11/7/22, 17:03 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Honestly it doesn’t help if I’m randomly plotting correlation heatmaps
11/7/22, 17:04 - Ottavio Oludovisi: What we are doing with DSF is at least pointing towards a case study
11/7/22, 17:04 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, I actually liked the last class though, when he took us through the court system data and hypothesis testing
11/7/22, 17:04 - Joseph: i think there is not much we can do for this course (hopefully there is), but what I suggest is to talk to Daria to prevent this for future courses, e.g. Big Data whatever, advanced balh blah
11/7/22, 17:05 - Joseph: if the majority agrees
11/7/22, 17:05 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah I really don’t want this to be theoretical if that’s the only big data class we’ll have for the program
11/7/22, 17:07 - Gabriel Rennó: agree
11/7/22, 17:07 - david: Ankit is gonna teach us (hopefully not) big data infrastructure
11/7/22, 17:08 - david: That scares me because at least I know a little bit of statistics
11/7/22, 17:08 - david: But Big Data Infrastructure sounds like the core of this master
11/7/22, 17:10 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah we’d be half dead in there and that’s the major portion lol
11/7/22, 17:14 - Joseph: I have created this form so we can vote on this 🙂 https://forms.gle/bhVpTrURsKF4prJa7
It´s asking for emails, just so we dont have duplicated answers
11/7/22, 17:14 - Joseph: Please fill, there is also a "i dont mind" option if you dont care
11/7/22, 17:15 - david: Done
11/7/22, 17:18 - Amos: Done
11/7/22, 17:21 - Ruben Tak: I voted for a new one, but I was wondering if we shouldn’t inform him about the problem first as well, as we now in a way will go over his head without informing him how we feel. Chances are ofcourse then that he will make promises to improve and there will not be looked for a new teacher
11/7/22, 17:22 - Ruben Tak: Just to speak my mind
11/7/22, 17:22 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Actually I agree with this, he seems very willing to do better, perhaps we owe him that
11/7/22, 17:23 - Joseph: I think we already did, a couple of times, but we can do it once more
11/7/22, 17:23 - Joseph: i think we have done it a couple of times, maybe we havent been clear neither on what we want/expect
11/7/22, 17:24 - Joseph: but sure, let´s speak our mind to him
11/7/22, 17:25 - Ruben Tak: But we as the students are the customers at the end of the day, we should try to make our time here of the highest quality as possible, despite the emotions that might get involved
11/7/22, 17:25 - david: He is kind of trying, that's why the last class was "better"
11/7/22, 17:26 - Ruben Tak: Let’s do it with daria as well in the conversation to make this process as short as possible
11/7/22, 17:26 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: So maybe tomorrows lecture can be last chance? I mean
He is doing remote - he knows
He needs to do good job to keep us motivated, more than in the class - if the studying style would be different, I think we should talk to Daria and be very clear.
11/7/22, 17:27 - Ruben Tak: Yeah but let’s inform him about it now, so he has some time to change some last things if he feels like he needs to
11/7/22, 17:27 - Joseph: you mean by email?
11/7/22, 17:27 - david: Talk with both at the same time is better so Anki will notice that we're really worry about this
11/7/22, 17:28 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I know that it will be the same, but I agree with Ruben, we should speak with him as well.
11/7/22, 17:28 - david: @12428076373 💪🏼
11/7/22, 17:29 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: So how do you think would be better to describe our pain? 😅
11/7/22, 17:29 - Ruben Tak: I think? 😅
11/7/22, 17:30 - Ruben Tak: I think we should make a customer journey map
11/7/22, 17:30 - Joseph: agree
11/7/22, 17:31 - david: Let's plot the results with Tableau
11/7/22, 17:32 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Guys, find something for skills maping
11/7/22, 17:33 - Gabriel Rennó: I agree that we as customers from bts have all the right to be upset with the service
11/7/22, 17:33 - Gabriel Rennó: So we should let daria or whoever know it asap
11/7/22, 17:35 - Joseph: I´d say talk with him tomorrow and with Daria in parallel, just saying what we feel, as for now 50% (7/7 votes) want a new teacher, so it´s not a small concern
11/7/22, 17:35 - Joseph: let´s speak to both, so either he can improve but at the same time for BTS to start thinking about possible solutions before we are down the wire
11/7/22, 17:37 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: *8/8
11/7/22, 17:44 - david: Probably I'm going to the school tomorrow so I can call Daria to join us
11/7/22, 18:54 - david: <Media omitted>

11/8/22, 16:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Cool, couse I can’t seem to find out where or if we need to do something

11/8/22, 16:49 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Done
11/8/22, 16:49 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Password is the same or did we get a code I didn’t see?
11/8/22, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: You have to sign up on your own I think?
11/8/22, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: But make sure to use the BTS email
11/8/22, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: I can’t remember what I did
11/8/22, 16:57 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ok it was obviously sent to spam, thanks a lot tho!

11/8/22, 21:08 - Joseph: Like Ankit?
11/8/22, 21:20 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Coming with him
11/8/22, 21:21 - Onassis Nottage: Sounds like you’re not coming at all then
11/8/22, 21:25 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Damn you’re right
11/8/22, 21:32 - david: @393663863107 is coming because he saw this
11/8/22, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: I appreciate this lecturer though
11/8/22, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: The classes may not be “perfect” but she’s doing a pretty good job at providing us with networking opportunities
11/8/22, 22:07 - Ottavio Oludovisi: So good, I agree
11/8/22, 22:08 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Dude you promised you wouldn’t tell

11/9/22, 12:15 - Onassis Nottage: Just an update everyone, I spoke with Daria before I left about Statistics
11/9/22, 12:16 - Onassis Nottage: She said next week we can all meet and discuss if you’d like
11/9/22, 12:16 - david: Sure
11/9/22, 12:16 - Onassis Nottage: If not just share your concerns if you haven’t done so already and I’ll talk about them
11/9/22, 12:16 - Onassis Nottage: Daria is also asking for us to fill out this survey so they can know if you want to attend or not
11/9/22, 12:31 - Gabriel Rennó: I would go
11/9/22, 12:45 - Joseph: I'm down
11/9/22, 12:46 - Onassis Nottage: Update

11/9/22, 15:59 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Couse I got this
11/9/22, 15:59 - Ottavio Oludovisi: <Media omitted>
11/9/22, 17:35 - Gabriel Rennó: I think you should use theme id
11/9/22, 17:35 - Gabriel Rennó: Btw how u guys manage to filter only the top 3 on query4?
11/9/22, 17:35 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yes! Thanks, joe helped me
11/9/22, 17:36 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Nameofcolumn in (1,2,3)
11/9/22, 17:36 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Where*
11/9/22, 17:37 - Gabriel Rennó: Not working for me
11/9/22, 17:37 - Gabriel Rennó: And do you know how to crate a new table from a query?
11/9/22, 17:37 - Gabriel Rennó: Instead of using “with”

11/10/22, 18:09 - Onassis Nottage: I guess not lol
11/10/22, 18:11 - Onassis Nottage: With q as (query 1),
With r as (query one but 2015)
Select *,
Select r.count(*)
From q
Left join r on r.Id = q.id
11/10/22, 18:11 - Onassis Nottage: Make sure the fields aren’t null
11/10/22, 18:12 - Onassis Nottage: And then something or other

11/18/22, 17:30 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Isn’t the colormap changing the colored image too? Doesn’t that like negate everything else we done?
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph: Maybe it's not cmd the right parameter haha but something like that
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph: The thing is that greyscale images dont have colors per se
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph: Just intensities
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph: So you choose th3 Palette
11/18/22, 17:32 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Makes sense

11/22/22, 14:14 - Onassis Nottage: *Masters Delegate Meeting - Tuesday November 22, 2022*
*Attendance:*
Daria (Coordinator)
Mayra (Coordinator)
Saskia (Delegate UX)
Ghandi (Delegate PM)
Leonie (Delegate DTM)
Onassis (Delegate BDAI)


*Notes:*

*Delegate meetings* - This space is to allow inclusive and human centered approach to share ideas. All meetings will not be recorded, in hopes to feel as a safe space to share any concern. These meetings are to share issues with BTS as a whole, if we need to meet as MBDS, we can ask for a meeting with Sergio and Daria offline.

*Coffee Machine* - They're currently in the process of trying to get an actual vending machine instead of a coffee machine

*Christmas event* - December 16th there will be a wine festival, it's a Christmas event, and we have sommeliers giving us different wine to taste during the experience

*Budgets and allocations* - If we have a collective idea for an event or product, just let me know and we can discuss as delegates to see if we can get backing from as many persons in BTS to get what we need. There is currently not a budget number related, but we can ask for an event with a description in advance, we can recommend an event for all of us in BTS.

*Global Chapters Program* - This is more of an immersion trip as opposed of internships, Daria will discuss to coordinate the trip and it can involve other students in the masters. I've also asked to see if we can raise money for some of the students who would like to go but don't have the funds to do it now.  

*UB Digital Badge* - We will have access to a few of the resources on the UB campus including access to the library by the end of this week. They have the information, but it's in Catalan so they're currently translating the documents to English for us. In the meantime they there are other library spaces they will send and coworking spaces they will list for us in the meantime (it's easy to apply for a library card).

*Wifi Hack* - BTS has different routers, if you're having bad connectivity, you can disconnect and reconnect to the nearest router in BTS

*Universal Microphone* - This term they should have a universal microphone (they're working to resolve the issues as soon as possible). The classroom noise we hear is only happening in our room, the other rooms don't have this issue, and it's only happening for persons who are remotely (not for persons who are online in the classroom).

*Lost and Found* - Any items in the lost and found can be checked by the reception, so if you ever lose anything, you can check there for them
Access to software - We will be using AWS for our Big Data Infrastructure course, and we have access to it for the entire year
11/22/22, 14:15 - Onassis Nottage: Meeting just ended, these were the notes I took. If I get anything else from them, I'll share it in here

12/1/22, 21:12 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yup
12/1/22, 21:13 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I wanted to go since at home is hard to find a comfortable spot but I’ll just be here if I’ll be alone 😞
12/1/22, 21:13 - Onassis Nottage: So it’s agreed, we all stay in our nice warm beds, while Otto regrets his life choices
12/1/22, 21:44 - Ottavio Oludovisi: That’s been going on for a while now
12/1/22, 21:56 - Andrea Pavelkova: We believe in you Otto, it'll be ok

12/2/22, 15:26 - Onassis Nottage: I liked this, although it wasn’t what I was expecting
12/2/22, 15:27 - Onassis Nottage: It was similar to our entrepreneurship class where Ana just gives a list of stuff to send us in the right direction
12/2/22, 15:27 - Joseph: That's life, welcome
12/2/22, 15:27 - Onassis Nottage: Lol
12/2/22, 23:43 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Who put a smiley face near my name on miro
12/3/22, 15:19 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Hey guys, about bacteria assignment, how you multiplied plot X axis on 5 min? where he says that picture is taken in every 5 min
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: You should use np.linspace
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: You have 30 images so
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: 0,120,30 i think
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Then when you reduce the images to 26 it becomes 
0,120,26
12/3/22, 15:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: solved already
12/3/22, 15:49 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Oopsie!
12/3/22, 15:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: just it was so easy and it was taking time :d
12/3/22, 15:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: thank you !
12/3/22, 15:49 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Sorry I was late!
12/3/22, 15:50 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: no worries !
12/3/22, 16:13 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: can someone share how to calculate chi_sq? I am getting different results
12/3/22, 16:14 - david: chi_sq[i] = np.sum((bact_area_wo - theo)**2)
12/4/22, 17:16 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Hey guys, by any chance does anybody know about exact requirements and the process for Work permit in Spain ? Or if you know a lawyer who you can recommend for such cases
12/4/22, 17:27 - david: No idea
12/4/22, 17:42 - Onassis Nottage: Check canvas
12/4/22, 17:42 - Onassis Nottage: There’s a work permit thing in there, and BTS I believe has to be involved
12/4/22, 17:44 - Onassis Nottage: Look at the modules page for everyone, where the job ads are, at the top of that part there should be documents on how to get a work permit
12/4/22, 17:46 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
12/4/22, 17:47 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Thank you ! I will check that
12/4/22, 17:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah I think BTS should be involved, have already contacted them
12/4/22, 17:57 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
12/4/22, 17:59 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah for sure,  I  meant with the information and contacts mainly, they must have some previous experience I think.

12/7/22, 17:19 - david: I'm gonna check it in 5 min
12/7/22, 17:28 - Onassis Nottage: Yup
12/7/22, 17:28 - Onassis Nottage: Lol
12/7/22, 17:29 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Like
12/7/22, 17:29 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I don’t think he looked at it
12/7/22, 17:31 - david: Why is it bad?
12/7/22, 17:32 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure
12/7/22, 17:32 - Ottavio Oludovisi: 121 Lines, you lose 10 to missing values, only a couple numerical columns with little to no utility
12/7/22, 17:32 - Ottavio Oludovisi: If you try to plot the price ranges you get a flat distribution couse the data is so little
12/7/22, 17:33 - david: Well yeah
12/7/22, 17:33 - Onassis Nottage: Did you try unplugging and waiting 20 seconds?
12/7/22, 17:33 - Ottavio Oludovisi: If you try with the colors you have so many it’s impossible to get any insight other than:
“ most popular colors are black and white”
12/7/22, 17:33 - Ottavio Oludovisi: ?
12/7/22, 17:34 - david: What else is important besides the price and the size(?=)
12/7/22, 17:34 - david: How life works
12/7/22, 17:37 - Onassis Nottage: Life hack my friend
12/7/22, 17:37 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: This works with everything 😂

12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: So
12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: Ankit for data infra?
12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: Hahahah
12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: 🫠
12/9/22, 13:03 - Joseph: 👎🏻
12/9/22, 13:06 - david: I don't think it will be that bad jaja
12/9/22, 13:09 - Joseph: Is he staying @12428076373 ? Do you know
12/9/22, 13:10 - Onassis Nottage: Well I asked Sergio on the masters call and he said he was getting someone else
12/9/22, 13:11 - david: Maybe they didn't find someone
12/9/22, 13:11 - Onassis Nottage: So when he said this
12/9/22, 13:11 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
12/9/22, 13:11 - david: You were like this
12/9/22, 13:12 - Onassis Nottage: Bey please lol, stop showing me that 🤣🤣🤣
12/9/22, 13:12 - Onassis Nottage: I already erased it from my memory
12/9/22, 13:12 - Gabriel Rennó: Hahahahahahahahah wtf
12/9/22, 13:13 - Onassis Nottage: Lol this is the most messed up sticker I’ve ever seen
12/9/22, 13:13 - david: <Media omitted>
12/9/22, 13:13 - Gabriel Rennó: Exactly 😂😂
12/9/22, 13:13 - Onassis Nottage: But yeah, either that… orrr they haven’t had the heart to tell him he’s not
12/9/22, 13:13 - Gabriel Rennó: Wtf is going on there
12/9/22, 13:14 - Gabriel Rennó: I have so many questions
12/9/22, 13:14 - Onassis Nottage: Oh yeah
12/9/22, 13:14 - Onassis Nottage: https://chat.openai.com/
12/9/22, 13:14 - Onassis Nottage: I forgot to mention this
12/9/22, 13:15 - Onassis Nottage: This is a chatbot that can retain a conversation
12/9/22, 13:15 - david: But I think that the problem was more the subject (statistics) than Ankit
12/9/22, 13:15 - Onassis Nottage: It's super cool to play around with
12/9/22, 13:15 - Gabriel Rennó: This is amazing
12/9/22, 13:15 - david: So I hope that big data infrastructure will be more acceptable
12/9/22, 13:15 - Gabriel Rennó: This and the dalle2
12/9/22, 13:15 - Gabriel Rennó: Gets me scared
12/9/22, 13:15 - Onassis Nottage: Not for me, I was fine with whatever he threw, the problem was no work or assignments, and moving classes to Fridays
12/9/22, 13:16 - Gabriel Rennó: Same
12/9/22, 13:16 - Onassis Nottage: In my undergrad for math, it was more theoretical, and I've still had more practical statistics assignments compared to this class
12/9/22, 13:16 - david: No assignments "because of the subject" according to him
12/9/22, 13:17 - david: Let's pray for the next course
12/9/22, 13:17 - Onassis Nottage: Super easy to blame everyone else
12/9/22, 13:17 - Onassis Nottage: There shouldn't be any theory
12/9/22, 13:17 - Onassis Nottage: But that's not what my issue is; it's more of actually having work to retain the information and practice
12/9/22, 13:19 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yup

12/12/22, 18:07 - Onassis Nottage: But there’s nothing on the calendar
12/12/22, 18:07 - david: No class, she told me that the new professor is preparing the things so he will have more time to do it better
12/12/22, 18:07 - Onassis Nottage: Ahh okay cool

12/14/22, 14:31 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Guys, did data driven business gave us any exact recommendations of what analysis need be done on assignment 2 ? How users of Mac are going to use PowerBI?
12/14/22, 14:46 - Onassis Nottage: I just gave the canvas
12/14/22, 14:46 - Onassis Nottage: I didn’t use power bi
12/14/22, 15:28 - Onassis Nottage: They’re not accepting forms

12/14/22, 18:36 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm giving him a Jupyter notebook with comments
12/14/22, 18:37 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I sent him a notebook, a power bi dashboard and the data analytics canvas, I’m scared
12/14/22, 18:38 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I am going to do the same!

12/22/22, 11:27 - Andrea Pavelkova: The class is basically Max going "ok so please install 467642 things" and me saying "nothing works"
12/22/22, 11:27 - Andrea Pavelkova: Then we struggle with tech issues for an hour
12/22/22, 11:28 - Andrea Pavelkova: Good luck skipping through the class recording in the future getting to the actual teaching parts

12/22/22, 11:32 - Onassis Nottage: Roberta should get a whole award for that class
12/22/22, 11:32 - david: The only problem with him is that he doesn't answer mails
12/22/22, 11:32 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Perhaps we should tell Sergio she was very good
12/22/22, 11:32 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah, we should somehow ask for Roberta lectures again
12/22/22, 11:32 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Nobody does really, just Roberta 🥲
12/22/22, 11:33 - Andrea Pavelkova: Giving us that real life example of how no one answers emails when u need it

12/22/22, 11:35 - Gabriel Rennó: I dont think she was THAT good. I think she is good when compared to the other ones
12/22/22, 11:35 - Gabriel Rennó: But in general
12/22/22, 11:35 - Gabriel Rennó: Nothing special

12/23/22, 11:44 - Onassis Nottage: Even though we had 4 classes
12/23/22, 11:44 - Onassis Nottage: Such a Professional
12/23/22, 12:12 - Gabriel Rennó: Pissed by what?
12/23/22, 12:13 - Onassis Nottage: This is the second time in all four classes he graded attendance
12/23/22, 12:14 - Onassis Nottage: But the grades only include two classes so there’s a 50% for those who didn’t show up
12/23/22, 12:14 - Onassis Nottage: When it should be 75% for those who only didn’t show up to one class
12/24/22, 06:28 - david: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjiWSihpij-/?igshid=Yzg5MTU1MDY=

12/28/22, 22:20 - Onassis Nottage: And on the day I decided to do the homework, I can’t even do it

12/28/22, 22:29 - Onassis Nottage: I had to do so much research for that lol
12/28/22, 22:31 - david: X2
12/29/22, 11:56 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Why
12/29/22, 11:56 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Do we have to deliver data driven for the 5th?

12/30/22, 18:14 - Orlando Marcos Torres: Talend needs jvm
12/30/22, 18:16 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
12/30/22, 18:16 - Onassis Nottage: What’s jvm?
12/30/22, 18:17 - Orlando Marcos Torres: Oh, you need to have jdk or jre installed before run talend

1/2/23, 17:09 - Ottavio Oludovisi: AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1/2/23, 17:09 - Gabriel Rennó: Its just doing EDA in tools less used than python
1/2/23, 17:09 - Gabriel Rennó: Doesnt make sense since we know how to use python for that
1/2/23, 17:10 - Ottavio Oludovisi: You guys crack me up I love you
1/2/23, 17:10 - Onassis Nottage: I’m just hurting my head trying to find solutions for mac users
1/2/23, 17:11 - Onassis Nottage: This guy never sent the getting started file
1/2/23, 17:11 - Onassis Nottage: I understand your pain now
1/2/23, 17:29 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/2/23, 17:44 - Onassis Nottage: This bey went for Amazon package 🤣🤣
1/2/23, 18:18 - Onassis Nottage: I have Talend 🥹
1/5/23, 16:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Anyone managed to export some sort of file for data driven business' second assignment?
1/5/23, 16:49 - Onassis Nottage: Was that mandatory?
1/5/23, 16:49 - Onassis Nottage: My plan was to take screenshots and write
1/5/23, 16:49 - Ottavio Oludovisi: It just says we must upload a "file"
1/5/23, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: Okay, no I never tried to export anything
1/5/23, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: I can try though
1/5/23, 16:52 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Onassis, Not to take into account assigmnemt, did you find Talend useful? I am not going to submit that assignment, unless you change my mind 😂😂
1/5/23, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/5/23, 16:55 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Thank you !
1/5/23, 17:05 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Im guessing we arent going to submit much
1/5/23, 17:06 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah I thought this was some revolutionary thingamajig lol
1/5/23, 17:06 - Onassis Nottage: And it could be useful in bigger companies
1/5/23, 19:32 - david: So who is not gonna present assignment 4?
1/5/23, 19:32 - Onassis Nottage: I'm doing it, just based on this entire thing, you just have to answer a few questions
1/5/23, 19:33 - Onassis Nottage: You have to assess the completeness, integrity, accuracy, uniqueness, and validity in two databases
1/5/23, 19:33 - Onassis Nottage: That won't take long, what took really long was just connecting to them
1/5/23, 19:33 - david: But the one with myphp
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: Did you run the SQL successfully?
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: I got errors
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: I was doing it manually
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: Remember yesterday when I was cursing a lot?
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, that wasn't just for kicks lol
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: But it's a lot
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: There's an option at the bottom
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: I thought it was because I used a macbook
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: But before you run the query, uncheck that button
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: That was the problem I had, but when I unchecked it, it worked
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: If anyone else had this same problem^
1/5/23, 19:38 - david: Still have an error "close to business"
1/5/23, 19:38 - david: 🫠
1/5/23, 19:41 - Onassis Nottage: Hmm
1/5/23, 19:41 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure what that means
1/5/23, 20:18 - david: I think it worked
1/5/23, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: I just sent mine in if anyone wants to build on theirs from it
1/5/23, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: Validity I just gave 100%
1/5/23, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: That was the only one I didnt think about
1/6/23, 12:54 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: <Media omitted>
1/6/23, 12:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I’m shocked

1/7/23, 13:43 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Maybe we will be able to see good competitor of Google ! 🤟

1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: Hey everyone
1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: Daria moved classes to Friday
1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: In case you missed it
1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: And the Agile assignment is graded
1/8/23, 13:53 - Joseph: Fuck it
1/8/23, 13:54 - Onassis Nottage: What happened?
1/8/23, 13:57 - Joseph: 1 i came back from holidays earlier to go tomorrow to class,  2 i have a train this Thursday night to go out the weekend... both cost money,  time and missing an important class
1/8/23, 13:58 - Onassis Nottage: You can just go online
1/8/23, 13:58 - Onassis Nottage: I’m still in The Bahamas lol
1/8/23, 13:58 - Onassis Nottage: Flying back on Thursday
1/8/23, 13:59 - Onassis Nottage: But also, now that you mention it
1/8/23, 13:59 - Onassis Nottage: There needs to be an agreement
1/8/23, 14:00 - Onassis Nottage: If a lecturer misses class, and the class is moved to a day where we’re not supposed to have it in the first place, there shouldn’t be any graded homework, quizzes or classroom assignments and that entire class is considered optional to attend
1/8/23, 14:01 - Onassis Nottage: Because if we missed classes during the times scheduled, there are repercussions for us
1/8/23, 14:01 - Nils Jenninssen: Good thought!
1/8/23, 14:03 - Onassis Nottage: This is the ideal solution, I’m not sure they’d agree to this though lol
1/8/23, 14:03 - Joseph: And i would say not on the same week,  as we have plans, meetings, other things
1/8/23, 14:04 - Joseph: They have to give us some time to plan ahead,  that what a calendar is made for
1/8/23, 14:04 - Onassis Nottage: Professionals with a capital P
1/8/23, 14:20 - Gabriel Rennó: Yeah i will also be out of barcelona on friday

1/8/23, 14:21 - Onassis Nottage: I… am also out of Barcelona on Friday as well 👀
1/8/23, 14:21 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/8/23, 14:21 - Gabriel Rennó: Yeah i know i just mean that it suck that they do this changes out of the blue
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: Come to think of it, we’re all out of Barcelona on Friday right?
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: Because i planned a trip on thirsday in order to not miss class
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: Anyways
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: I might just be on zoom
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: Oh wait
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: Not big deal after all
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: I’m actually not going to be in class for real
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: I’m leaving Thursday, but I wont land until 10am Friday
1/8/23, 14:24 - Joseph: If everyone is okay,  I'd ask to move it to the next available Friday
1/8/23, 14:24 - Joseph: Or even later
1/8/23, 14:25 - Onassis Nottage: I won’t be there next week Friday either

1/8/23, 17:51 - Onassis Nottage: We can, but I just gave it an extra month for everyone to get ready
1/8/23, 17:52 - david: Because the winter and the snow doesn't last until March I guess

1/8/23, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: I spoke with some of the other students
1/8/23, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: I think we can plan our own trip to California
1/8/23, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: That’s way too much money to visit “companies like” Google
1/8/23, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: The housing and plane aren’t included in the price
1/8/23, 22:07 - Andrea Pavelkova: Rip
1/8/23, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: I don’t mind doing it if thats what everyone wants, but I’m sure we can plan something ourselves
1/8/23, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: $5k for each person would get us a really nice place, plane ticket, and things to do over there
1/10/23, 12:01 - Onassis Nottage: 🫠

1/10/23, 12:08 - Onassis Nottage: I have to study a lot after this
1/10/23, 12:09 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Too technical? Let's see 😅 big data/engineering part is really difficult
1/10/23, 12:10 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah it’s technical, but I just think its a lot to grap in such a short time
1/10/23, 12:11 - Onassis Nottage: Just have to do some research on the physical systems and play with AWS after this ends

1/17/23, 17:34 - Onassis Nottage: Guess who also got blocked on idealista :)
1/17/23, 17:37 - david: Try with Scrapy
1/17/23, 17:38 - Onassis Nottage: OrI could just turn it in and hope it works
1/17/23, 17:46 - david: Can you send me the last piece of code we saw for extracting the details?
1/17/23, 17:46 - david: The 2 lines of code that he showed us
1/17/23, 18:01 - Onassis Nottage: I have no idea lol
1/17/23, 18:03 - david: <Media omitted>
1/17/23, 19:08 - Onassis Nottage: I don't have that
1/17/23, 19:08 - Onassis Nottage: I think I got rid of it
1/17/23, 19:19 - Gabriel Rennó: He was supposed to upload on canvas
1/17/23, 19:31 - david: He didn't upload the recorded lecture
1/17/23, 19:31 - david: Neither
1/17/23, 19:33 - Onassis Nottage: Sigh
1/17/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: He's gonna get whatever I give him
1/17/23, 19:35 - david: And then you get a 100
1/17/23, 19:36 - Onassis Nottage: I'd love to see that lol

1/17/23, 19:40 - Onassis Nottage: I had to pull 500 accounts to get 90 of them that had the size
1/17/23, 19:43 - david: Good to know
1/17/23, 20:25 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yep, got banned
1/17/23, 20:38 - Onassis Nottage: I did a Hail Mary
1/17/23, 20:42 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/17/23, 20:42 - Onassis Nottage: It's super abstract
1/17/23, 20:43 - Onassis Nottage: I still scraped the site without knowing if anything works lol
1/17/23, 20:44 - Onassis Nottage: But I'm turning it in
1/17/23, 20:44 - Ottavio Oludovisi: So you didnt compare london and barcelona
1/17/23, 20:45 - Ottavio Oludovisi: But the sites?
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: What do you mean?
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: Aren't we supposed to compare it?
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: Rightmove is London
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: And Idealista is Barcelona
1/17/23, 20:46 - Onassis Nottage: Did I get confused?
1/17/23, 20:46 - Onassis Nottage: 👀
1/17/23, 20:47 - Ottavio Oludovisi: yeah but you said that rightmove has a higer squared meter price than idealista
1/17/23, 20:47 - Onassis Nottage: No
1/17/23, 20:47 - Ottavio Oludovisi: While the difference is the city thats all
1/17/23, 20:47 - Onassis Nottage: That's just me testing the data
1/17/23, 20:47 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Then im confused
1/17/23, 20:48 - Onassis Nottage: The abstract says that "whatever is the highest" has a higher squared meter price than "whatever has the lowest"
1/17/23, 20:48 - Onassis Nottage: Or should I have said London and Barcelona, instead of Rightmove and Idealista?
1/17/23, 20:49 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/17/23, 20:49 - Joseph: I'm still blocked from idealista
1/17/23, 20:49 - Onassis Nottage: Me too
1/17/23, 20:49 - Ottavio Oludovisi: So you managed to scrape idealista?
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: Not at all lmaoo
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: I'm still continuing as if I had
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: And turning that in
1/17/23, 20:50 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Oh you're just using test data, sorry im tired
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: I'm not using any data
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: Just writing code
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: No idea if this will work
1/17/23, 20:50 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ok i will now stop asking questions
1/17/23, 20:51 - Onassis Nottage: But I won't have time to think about that, since I'm traveling
1/17/23, 20:51 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaoooo

1/17/23, 22:20 - Ottavio Oludovisi: @12428076373 I lost my notebook too for some reason, can you post the code for th elondon stuff where you need to specify dd and dt classes?

1/18/23, 18:32 - Gabriel Rennó: I dont have it but i managed the code to extract the info from the london website
1/18/23, 18:32 - Gabriel Rennó: Is that what you need or sth else?

1/19/23, 11:05 - Onassis Nottage: @4915750950176 can you resend the API and link?
1/19/23, 11:16 - Onassis Nottage: Got it
1/19/23, 11:59 - david: At the end he is gonna delete the whole code so he won't have an error
1/19/23, 12:00 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ahahahahah
1/19/23, 12:01 - Onassis Nottage: That took a minute
1/19/23, 12:11 - Joseph: does he even know?
1/19/23, 12:12 - Afolabi: 🤣🤣🤣
1/19/23, 12:12 - david: He told us to code so we can learn but he doesn't even know how to fix an error
1/19/23, 12:13 - Ottavio Oludovisi: “Oh Ottavio you are too harsh , he isn’t that bad”

1/19/23, 12:15 - david: I didn't
1/19/23, 12:16 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Guys if we trained the data that would be the trained data
1/19/23, 12:16 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ok ill stop
1/19/23, 12:19 - david: That's why I gave him a 1 in the last poll
1/19/23, 12:20 - Joseph: q: how to fix an error in python?
a: delete the line
1/19/23, 12:21 - david: He's clicking stop to delete the results
1/19/23, 12:21 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm so confused
1/19/23, 12:21 - david: He's more than you
1/19/23, 12:23 - david: He just did it again
1/19/23, 12:23 - Joseph: if you have multiple errors, just do a for loop
1/19/23, 12:24 - Joseph: for error in jupyter:
     q: how to fix an error in python?

1/19/23, 12:29 - Gabriel Rennó: he didnt. I asked him but he gave a trash explanation
1/19/23, 12:30 - david: He said because you need it to train
1/19/23, 12:30 - Onassis Nottage: Y’all are hilarious
1/19/23, 12:31 - david: He should take some machine learning classes
1/19/23, 12:31 - david: On kaggle
1/19/23, 12:31 - Andrea Pavelkova: So what he meant by "I need your participation" was actually "I need you to fix my code for me"
1/19/23, 12:31 - david: That makes a lot of sense
1/19/23, 12:32 - Joseph: "I need you to learn along side me"
1/19/23, 12:35 - Onassis Nottage: pip install Andrea
1/19/23, 12:37 - Andrea Pavelkova: If I was an AI I would be so happy...
1/19/23, 12:38 - Onassis Nottage: 😂😂😂😂
1/19/23, 12:39 - david: Until now
1/19/23, 12:40 - Andrea Pavelkova: We should run a model to predict how the next classes go

1/19/23, 12:43 - david: "Don't take as a fatality that I don't know how to code"

1/19/23, 12:52 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm sitting here like ???????
1/19/23, 12:52 - david: Thanks for nothing
1/19/23, 12:53 - Andrea Pavelkova: I wanted him to feel like I spoke at least once
1/19/23, 13:30 - Onassis Nottage: He was calling you and some others earlier in the class but no one answered
1/19/23, 13:30 - Andrea Pavelkova: Oh, must have missed it :(

1/19/23, 22:37 - Joseph: I'm going
1/19/23, 22:37 - Ruben Tak: 👌
1/20/23, 09:10 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Am i the only ine that thinks this is barbaric and against privacy?
1/20/23, 09:10 - Ottavio Oludovisi: one*
1/20/23, 09:13 - Onassis Nottage: That's actually a thing here apparently

1/20/23, 10:04 - Onassis Nottage: It works!
1/20/23, 10:04 - Andrea Pavelkova: Much better, thanks!
1/20/23, 10:16 - Gabriel Rennó: Am i the only one who feel thats slightly wrong?
1/20/23, 10:16 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Apparently not
1/20/23, 10:16 - Gabriel Rennó: Hahaha
1/20/23, 10:17 - Joseph: we are here to learn, everyone, including the teacher
1/20/23, 10:18 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I am at a point where i dont think it is fun anymore

1/20/23, 10:33 - Onassis Nottage: Kml
1/20/23, 10:33 - Onassis Nottage: I don’t think today was as bad as yesterday
1/20/23, 10:34 - Onassis Nottage: It felt like yesterday he made it up as he went
1/20/23, 10:34 - Onassis Nottage: So far*

1/20/23, 10:35 - Onassis Nottage: That’s not true
1/20/23, 10:35 - Onassis Nottage: I think I would’ve still been home
1/20/23, 10:35 - Gabriel Rennó: 😂😂
1/20/23, 10:37 - Ottavio Oludovisi: <Media omitted>
1/20/23, 10:39 - Joseph: Send him the clip
1/20/23, 11:31 - Andrea Pavelkova: Did he just.... ask me a question and then answer himself
1/20/23, 11:31 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm so confused by this guy
1/20/23, 11:32 - Gabriel Rennó: And he gave the wrong answer
1/20/23, 11:32 - Onassis Nottage: He’s trying to see who’s online
1/20/23, 11:39 - Ottavio Oludovisi: He doesn’t know
1/20/23, 11:40 - Onassis Nottage: I noticed 😪
1/20/23, 11:40 - Joseph: haha
1/20/23, 11:42 - Onassis Nottage: Thank you Joe

1/20/23, 11:47 - Joseph: oh snap
1/20/23, 11:47 - Andrea Pavelkova: So the purpose of the class is not for him to show us but for us to go out there, experiment and find out 🤔
1/20/23, 11:52 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Yes I am paying do that this guy copies code and then expects us to go find out for ourselves
1/20/23, 11:52 - Ottavio Oludovisi: So*
1/20/23, 11:54 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaoooooo
1/20/23, 11:57 - david: Started to snow today in Amsterdam

Idealista or we just gonna bail? I vote for the latter :)
1/21/23, 12:02 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Should I mail Miguel?
1/21/23, 12:16 - Nils Jenninssen: After switching IPs it works for me, but as soon as a next page is opened, I’m getting blocked :/
1/21/23, 12:17 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Same :(
1/21/23, 12:17 - Nils Jenninssen: There is an undetected-Webbrowser as well, but it’s no better yet
1/21/23, 12:21 - Joseph: I did it with a different website
1/21/23, 12:22 - Joseph: https://www.habitaclia.com/alquiler-barcelona.htm
1/21/23, 12:23 - david: I'm 100% sure that Miguel already knew that Idealista was going to block us
1/21/23, 12:23 - david: He put Idealista just for fun
1/21/23, 12:26 - david: I used Badi instead of Idealista and got the results to compare "something" at least
1/21/23, 12:40 - Joseph: I did and he told me it was okay to use the other website

1/21/23, 14:21 - david: The click() doesnt work, the error says element not interactable
1/21/23, 14:22 - Nils Jenninssen: Will look into it :)
1/21/23, 14:22 - david: Thanks!
1/21/23, 14:25 - Joseph: Try use get if it's not a button
1/21/23, 14:25 - Joseph: If it's an href url you're getting
1/21/23, 14:26 - Joseph: .get(href link)
1/21/23, 14:28 - david: I think the html is not considering as a link, but as an action
1/21/23, 14:28 - david: Because the button is to add an item to the shop cart

1/21/23, 19:53 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Do you guys know how to extract “<p class…” objects?
1/21/23, 19:53 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I’m going crazy
1/21/23, 19:54 - david: With xpath
1/21/23, 19:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I tried copying the xpath straight from the html
1/21/23, 19:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: But it won’t find it
1/21/23, 19:55 - Ottavio Oludovisi: How would you structure the query?
1/21/23, 19:56 - david: Send me your code and tell me what you want to get
1/21/23, 19:57 - david: I'll be at home in 5 min
1/21/23, 19:58 - Ottavio Oludovisi: <Media omitted>
1/21/23, 19:59 - Ottavio Oludovisi: my code is just hard to send since my urls are variables etc.
1/21/23, 19:59 - Ottavio Oludovisi: but i cant seem to be able to select this piece pf html
1/21/23, 20:06 - david: This is Badi?
1/21/23, 20:07 - david: asdf = driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"//p[contains(@class, 'listing-pricing__square-meter')]").text
1/21/23, 20:07 - david: Try that
1/21/23, 20:13 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Won’t work
1/21/23, 20:15 - david: Send me the link
1/21/23, 20:31 - Ottavio Oludovisi: https://www.spotahome.com/barcelona/for-rent:apartments/120942
1/21/23, 20:32 - Arda Altintas: Hello guys, I am also having some problem. I used this website and I was able to get the price. But I can't get the area or the price-per-m2 values. It returns empty cells in the dataframe. Did anybody face any issue like that?
1/21/23, 20:33 - Arda Altintas: <Media omitted>
1/21/23, 20:34 - Arda Altintas: I assigned a random value for the area column just to move on but it's better if I get the real ones 😅
1/21/23, 20:37 - david: <Media omitted>
1/21/23, 20:37 - david: 🤨
1/21/23, 20:38 - Ottavio Oludovisi: For some reason it won’t work for me
1/21/23, 20:38 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I’m guessing it’s something with the web browser
1/21/23, 20:38 - david: from selenium import webdriver

1/21/23, 20:38 - david: Just run the code

1/21/23, 20:52 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Guys, how you go on the next page on Idealista?
1/21/23, 20:52 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: This message was deleted
1/21/23, 20:52 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: something like this: driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//li[@class='next']/a")
1/21/23, 20:56 - david: Returns empty for me too
1/21/23, 20:56 - david: Everyone got blocked from Idealista, we can't do web scraping
1/21/23, 20:59 - Arda Altintas: oh, ok thanks. I think I'll just submit with made up values :D
1/21/23, 21:13 - david: But you can use this asdf = driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"//li[contains(@class, 'feature feature-surface')]").get_attribute('outerHTML')
1/21/23, 21:13 - david: You will get it after cleaning the result
1/21/23, 21:20 - Arda Altintas: thanks I'll try that👍🏻
1/21/23, 21:24 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ok I reinstalled the libraries and it works now
1/21/23, 21:24 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Thanks a lot for taking the time to help! ❤️
1/21/23, 21:27 - Arda Altintas: driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"//li[contains(@class,'feature feature-surface')]/strong").get_attribute('innerHTML')
1/21/23, 21:27 - Arda Altintas: this directly gives the number
1/21/23, 21:34 - david: Niceee, I just found out some minutes ago that what you get with this: driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"//li[contains(@class, 'feature feature-surface')]/strong")
it's what is inside of <strong> but in that HTML there is nothing, the price is outside
1/21/23, 21:37 - david: It gives you what is from "<strong" to ">"
1/21/23, 21:38 - david: So when you do this: driver.find_element(By.XPATH,"//li[contains(@class,'feature feature-surface')]") 
it will give you what is inside "li" and it goes from "<li" to ">" so you receive 
this: 
 <li class=feature feature-surface">
and the price was not there neither

1/24/23, 13:37 - Joseph: I got stuck
1/24/23, 13:38 - Joseph: More than an extension I'd ask for more explanation
1/24/23, 13:38 - david: Mine is not working properly and I dont know why

1/24/23, 22:29 - Onassis Nottage: At this point I'm just going to be an online student with @421940514921
1/24/23, 22:29 - Gabriel Rennó: Did it work?
1/24/23, 22:30 - Onassis Nottage: No, I forgot to install sqlite3
1/24/23, 22:40 - Onassis Nottage: I’m going to bed Ine on this run anymore

1/24/23, 22:47 - Onassis Nottage: Alright, _last_ one
1/24/23, 22:59 - Orlando Marcos Torres: I don't recommend to use elastic beanstalk, It's better to use only ECS
1/24/23, 23:00 - Orlando Marcos Torres: event you can control better If you use api gateway for flask apis
1/25/23, 10:28 - Andrea Pavelkova: How did you guys sign up for the AWS Learner Lab because it sure isn't working for me 🤔
1/25/23, 10:56 - Onassis Nottage: We got the link in the email
1/25/23, 10:57 - Onassis Nottage: AWS sends an email to sign up
1/25/23, 11:34 - Andrea Pavelkova: Hmm
1/25/23, 11:36 - david: I resent you the mail
1/25/23, 12:16 - david: Guys the professor started

1/25/23, 18:52 - Joseph: That deserves a Nobel
1/25/23, 18:52 - Joseph: Nobels should be called Roubens actually
1/25/23, 18:52 - Onassis Nottage: 😂😂😂 I would’ve never thought of that
1/25/23, 18:52 - Onassis Nottage: Lolol
1/25/23, 20:31 - Ruben Tak: 😏😏
1/26/23, 09:16 - Onassis Nottage: @491773066688 I talked about online marketing sales funnels
1/26/23, 09:16 - Onassis Nottage: You can just say do the same for politics
1/26/23, 09:52 - Andrea Pavelkova: For next time, everyone use a looped video through OBS virtual camera
1/26/23, 10:03 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Backspace until days 😂
1/26/23, 10:10 - Onassis Nottage: 👀👀👀
1/26/23, 10:12 - Onassis Nottage: Is that what you’re using now? 👀
1/26/23, 10:13 - Andrea Pavelkova: No, but I sure wanna try 😂
1/26/23, 10:18 - david: You are confusing him more ottavio
1/26/23, 10:37 - Gabriel Rennó: Can someone share the notebook?

1/26/23, 10:55 - Onassis Nottage: He wants us to do the same thing again, but have Excellent, Very Good, Good, Bad, and Very Bad
1/26/23, 10:57 - Andrea Pavelkova: Oh ok thanks
1/26/23, 11:43 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Can someone share latest 2 file?

1/26/23, 12:07 - david: @12428076373 let Max answer 🤨
1/26/23, 12:08 - Onassis Nottage: He takes too long lol, I just wanna get through this already
1/26/23, 12:09 - david: He should not be coding
1/26/23, 12:09 - david: If he doesn't know how it works
1/26/23, 12:09 - Joseph: thanks!
1/26/23, 12:15 - david: Great explanation of inertia
1/26/23, 12:16 - Onassis Nottage: See what I mean?
1/26/23, 12:16 - david: He's the professor, he must know
1/26/23, 12:17 - david: We are not paying to receive an "I don't know how to explain" of the professor
1/26/23, 12:30 - Joseph: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/machine-learning/modules/dspath-clustering/cheatsheet
1/26/23, 12:33 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I did that :(
1/26/23, 12:34 - david: It should not replace, it should choose the highest and eliminate the lowest score
1/26/23, 12:35 - david: We are not doing assignment for nothing
1/26/23, 12:35 - Onassis Nottage: You don’t have to
1/26/23, 12:35 - Onassis Nottage: I want to replace it so my grade can get higher
1/26/23, 12:35 - Onassis Nottage: That 4 didn’t sit right with me
1/26/23, 12:36 - david: Yeah but for you
1/26/23, 12:36 - Joseph: always thinking about getting higher
1/26/23, 12:36 - Gabriel Rennó: What you talking bout? I closed the meeting
1/26/23, 12:36 - Onassis Nottage: I asked if he could replace the graded assignment over the break with the 2nd assignment everyone got low scores on
1/26/23, 12:36 - Onassis Nottage: So whatever is the highest gets saved
1/26/23, 12:37 - Onassis Nottage: And whatever is the lowest gets removed
1/26/23, 12:37 - Ottavio Oludovisi: You are saying the same thing guys
1/26/23, 12:37 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah I know, he said he closed before he heard ^
1/26/23, 12:38 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I meant david
1/26/23, 12:38 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Anyway
1/26/23, 12:38 - Onassis Nottage: Oh yeah
1/26/23, 12:38 - Ottavio Oludovisi: We all happy
1/26/23, 12:38 - david: Whatever
1/26/23, 12:39 - Onassis Nottage: You don’t have to do the assignment
1/26/23, 12:39 - Onassis Nottage: I’m saying over the break I did it
1/26/23, 12:39 - Onassis Nottage: And I’d like to use that in place of the assignment I got a 4 on
1/26/23, 12:40 - Onassis Nottage: If you don’t do it, nothing will change
1/26/23, 12:41 - david: Are you comfortable with the classes, aren't you? Because instead of changing grades to pass the course we should be learning this course
1/26/23, 12:42 - david: I don't know if I'm the only person who thinks that Max doesn't know what he's doing when he codes
1/26/23, 12:42 - Onassis Nottage: And you only feel that way about his class?
1/26/23, 12:42 - Onassis Nottage: You’re absolutely fine with Big data?
1/26/23, 12:42 - david: I already talk with Sergio about it
1/26/23, 12:43 - david: What did you propose to him?
1/26/23, 12:43 - david: I'd like to know
1/26/23, 12:43 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I think big data is fine, its just that he needs to adjust to our knowledge and go slower perhaps
1/26/23, 12:43 - Onassis Nottage: I didn’t propose anything, because you said you spoke to him already
1/26/23, 12:43 - david: This week, but this is coming from some weeks ago
1/26/23, 12:44 - david: You are the delegate, I should not do this
1/26/23, 12:44 - Onassis Nottage: Then don’t
1/26/23, 12:44 - Onassis Nottage: I never asked you to
1/26/23, 12:44 - david: Then do it
1/26/23, 12:44 - Onassis Nottage: You volunteered yourself
1/26/23, 12:45 - david: Because you are enjoying the classes
1/26/23, 12:45 - david: Because you understand but for someone who doesn't, what do we do?
1/26/23, 12:45 - Onassis Nottage: You’re acting like I knew this stuff beforehand
1/26/23, 12:45 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I agree with David that Max is not good coder and with Otto that Big Data can be adjusted with time, he is good guy.
1/26/23, 12:46 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I knew most of this staff beforehand, he is not explaining well
1/26/23, 12:46 - david: Because If you were lost you already asked for something
1/26/23, 12:46 - Onassis Nottage: But I did speak to Daria
1/26/23, 12:46 - Onassis Nottage: What?
1/26/23, 12:47 - david: The classes, the assignments, the codes, everything is a joke
1/26/23, 12:47 - Onassis Nottage: That’s really funny considering I got rid of Ankit although I was the only one with the background in math
1/26/23, 12:48 - david: We are not talking about statistics
1/26/23, 12:48 - Onassis Nottage: So every lecturer that comes in that you don’t like I should get rid of
1/26/23, 12:48 - Onassis Nottage: 📝
1/26/23, 12:48 - Onassis Nottage: Gotchu
1/26/23, 12:48 - Onassis Nottage: Ask and you shall receive
1/26/23, 12:48 - Gabriel Rennó: I agree with david that he is not the best teacher for this but i dont think there is much more onassis can do as a delegate since sergio already know about this
1/26/23, 12:48 - Onassis Nottage: So I’ll ask to get rid of Max
1/26/23, 12:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Guys
1/26/23, 12:48 - david: Are you real?
1/26/23, 12:48 - Ottavio Oludovisi: You gotta chill
1/26/23, 12:48 - Onassis Nottage: I’ll also ask to get rid of Marti
1/26/23, 12:49 - Ottavio Oludovisi: We all are frustrated about max, we probably cant do much about that
1/26/23, 12:49 - Onassis Nottage: Sounds like he wants me to end the guys life or something
1/26/23, 12:49 - Joseph: and Miguel
1/26/23, 12:49 - Onassis Nottage: I already spoke to Daria about it
1/26/23, 12:49 - Onassis Nottage: Right
1/26/23, 12:49 - david: What did you propose?
1/26/23, 12:49 - Gabriel Rennó: I mean you david is right to me pissed about this, i am too, but its not onassis (or any of us) fault
1/26/23, 12:50 - Ottavio Oludovisi: We should definitely make our voices loud couse its bad for someone with these teching skills to be here
1/26/23, 12:50 - Ottavio Oludovisi: That said, we are gonna have to deal with him
1/26/23, 12:50 - david: Exactly
1/26/23, 12:50 - Onassis Nottage: What do you want to do?
1/26/23, 12:51 - david: I proposed to Sergio that he should take advantage of the time at teach us theory. I think he's a little bit better with that but not for coding. Nothing related with code because he just reads what are the paremeters for and only that
1/26/23, 12:51 - Onassis Nottage: Back up for a second
1/26/23, 12:52 - Onassis Nottage: The last lecture was too much theory
1/26/23, 12:52 - Onassis Nottage: Statistics I mean*
1/26/23, 12:52 - Onassis Nottage: Actually okay
1/26/23, 12:52 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I dont agree with how david is relating to Onassis, we shhould all just calm down for a second and work toghether
1/26/23, 12:52 - Onassis Nottage: Is that what everyone wants?
1/26/23, 12:52 - Onassis Nottage: I absolutely agree
1/26/23, 12:52 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Lets just see it for how it is
1/26/23, 12:53 - Joseph: i like the approach, just dont think Max is the best doing it, but only theory would not work for me
1/26/23, 12:53 - Onassis Nottage: And if theory doesnt work for Joe
1/26/23, 12:53 - Onassis Nottage: But it works for David
1/26/23, 12:53 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I propose we send a collective letter to Sergio where we say this course was a disaster, that we understand it's impossible to do much, but this is not a master's level class, and we feel like we should be accredited more
1/26/23, 12:53 - Joseph: so I guess there is not much to do with Max atm, only him studying his material before the class, I guess
1/26/23, 12:53 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: We have 4 or 5 lectures left, it is too late vital changes for this subject I think 🥲 hope Max is not teaching us anything in the future . Guys we are together in this, I do not think there is anyones fault
1/26/23, 12:54 - Joseph: maybe Onnasis can teach?
1/26/23, 12:54 - Joseph: Onassis*
1/26/23, 12:54 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaoo
1/26/23, 12:54 - Onassis Nottage: Nah, this is Mamukas class
1/26/23, 12:55 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: We can go B2B
1/26/23, 12:55 - Joseph: per to per
1/26/23, 12:55 - Joseph: peer to peer
1/26/23, 12:56 - david: I'm not saying is Onassis fault but instead of just reading the code the whole class, it's better if read it and understand it
1/26/23, 12:56 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: And the beat song will be that moment from today's lecture: Our,our,our,our,our segmentation
1/26/23, 12:56 - david: Instead of listening to him 4 hours
1/26/23, 12:56 - david: Just reading
1/26/23, 12:56 - Onassis Nottage: We literally do the same thing in Miguel’s class
1/26/23, 12:56 - Joseph: i mean, also this theory vs practice, Sergio should decide and have a stronger opinion. He should know what we should be learning in each course, he knows better the big picture. Maybe it´s meant to be more theory, maybe not.
1/26/23, 12:57 - david: Miguel knows what he's coding, you can not compare them
1/26/23, 12:57 - david: If you have a question, he will answer it
1/26/23, 12:57 - Onassis Nottage: So your problem isn’t the code
1/26/23, 12:57 - Onassis Nottage: The style*
1/26/23, 12:57 - Onassis Nottage: You just want him to answer every question that pops up
1/26/23, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: But I’m just saying Miguel’s code just backfired last class
1/26/23, 12:58 - david: You deleted this message
1/26/23, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: And in previous instances
1/26/23, 12:58 - Joseph: but Miguel explains why haha and knows how to answer questions
1/26/23, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: Exactly
1/26/23, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: That’s what I’m getting at
1/26/23, 12:58 - david: The problem is that Max earns our money for reading a code he found on internet
1/26/23, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: So does Ana
1/26/23, 12:58 - david: And doesn't know how it works of what is for
1/26/23, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: But I’ve yet to hear complaints about her
1/26/23, 12:59 - Joseph: but this is a more important class, at least for me
1/26/23, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: But what should we do?
1/26/23, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: What exactly should we do
1/26/23, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: Get rid of the guy?
1/26/23, 12:59 - Ottavio Oludovisi: <Media omitted>
1/26/23, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: If this is what the majority wants then let’s do it
1/26/23, 12:59 - Joseph: i already knew most of the things Ana thought,I was not happy, but i did not care much, I care more about this
1/26/23, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
1/26/23, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: I just think he takes too long to explain
1/26/23, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: And I wanted to get the other code out of the way
1/26/23, 13:00 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Ana is here because she know half the unicorns in spain, she is supposed to be someone we can go to if we want to work here
1/26/23, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: Just say it
1/26/23, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: If this is what everyone agrees, I’ll say it with no problem
1/26/23, 13:00 - Joseph: ask Daria/Sergio for a solution, they should be the resposible ones to giving solutions of what should we do
1/26/23, 13:01 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I dont feel comfortable saying that to someone straight to his face in frot of a class
1/26/23, 13:01 - Onassis Nottage: If we leave it up to them, he’ll stay
1/26/23, 13:01 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I agree
1/26/23, 13:01 - Onassis Nottage: They’re basically the provosts
1/26/23, 13:01 - Onassis Nottage: No no, the burden should fall on me, I agree
1/26/23, 13:01 - Ottavio Oludovisi: But there is no way we get someone else, he IS gonna stay
1/26/23, 13:01 - Onassis Nottage: But what I don’t like is the disrespect I’m sure I wasn’t going to get if I was there in person
1/26/23, 13:02 - Ottavio Oludovisi: We should complaon because we paid and we are entitled to proper education, but i understand its a complicated debt to pay
1/26/23, 13:02 - Ottavio Oludovisi: I agree that the tones were a little bit too harsh, also i dont think its entirely on you to take account for this matters
1/26/23, 13:02 - Onassis Nottage: So next time guys, if anyone has something they really want to say to me, say it to my face
1/26/23, 13:02 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Even though you are the delegate we should still communicate as a group
1/26/23, 13:03 - Onassis Nottage: When I spoke to Daria, she mentioned she noticed the low scores
1/26/23, 13:04 - Onassis Nottage: And I explained to her what was happening in the class
1/26/23, 13:04 - Joseph: we love you Onassis! Is not against :) we are on the same team! 😘😘😘
1/26/23, 13:04 - Onassis Nottage: As a _delegate_ I don’t propose solutions behind anyones backs
1/26/23, 13:04 - Onassis Nottage: Whatever I have to say represents the majority of our group
1/26/23, 13:04 - Onassis Nottage: My decision is not what matters
1/26/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: Which is why I have always asked what the majority wants
1/26/23, 13:05 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Agreed
1/26/23, 13:05 - david: That's why I started the topic here, with all of you
1/26/23, 13:05 - Ottavio Oludovisi: In fact I think that the problem is being faced now, not earlier, before it was just us complaining
1/26/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: No no, you asked me what I proposed
1/26/23, 13:06 - Onassis Nottage: What am I supposed to propose if I haven’t asked anyone about it?
1/26/23, 13:06 - Onassis Nottage: If I did propose something that would’ve made everything worse
1/26/23, 13:06 - Onassis Nottage: But yeah let’s just move pass this thing
1/26/23, 13:06 - david: You said you told Daria something
1/26/23, 13:07 - Onassis Nottage: What’s everyones thoughts
1/26/23, 13:07 - david: @12428076373 I'm sorry if I disrespected you, that's not what I came to with my comments
1/26/23, 13:07 - Joseph: anyways.... I agree with David that he is just reading the code, so what I would suggest is to talk with sergio or him directly and ask him before every class to read his code, understand it and be able to exaplain it, if there is something he doesnt know, to research about it and be prepare to answer questions about what he is presenting
1/26/23, 13:07 - Onassis Nottage: Please read the chat
1/26/23, 13:07 - Onassis Nottage: At this point I just need to know what’s on everyone’s minds
1/26/23, 13:07 - Ruben Tak: This is not working over WhatsApp guys
1/26/23, 13:07 - Joseph: i am sure he will not know all the answers, but at least some haha at least the "basic/obvious" ones
1/26/23, 13:07 - Ruben Tak: We can discuss after classes or something
1/26/23, 13:08 - Joseph: if you guys were just here 🥲
1/26/23, 13:08 - Joseph: but yeah I agree
1/26/23, 13:08 - Onassis Nottage: I wasn’t sure if I got Covid or not so I stayed home this week

2/4/23, 20:40 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Did the endorphins do their job tho?
2/4/23, 21:01 - Onassis Nottage: Sure did 🥲
2/4/23, 21:02 - Onassis Nottage: I was almost to the top of the mountain, one side was death
2/4/23, 21:02 - Onassis Nottage: The other side was extra death
2/4/23, 21:02 - Onassis Nottage: I said yknow what, let me walk back down this mountain
2/4/23, 21:02 - Onassis Nottage: I looked back, and it was super steep 🥲
2/4/23, 21:02 - Onassis Nottage: If I tripped even once I was a goner 🤣🤣🤣
2/4/23, 21:03 - Onassis Nottage: And that’s when the endorphins kicked in, and I flew myself to the top 😅
2/4/23, 21:04 - Onassis Nottage: My kind doesn’t do this shit at all, idk what part of my DNA likes hiking
2/5/23, 11:45 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Wtf

2/14/23, 14:56 - Onassis Nottage: Delegates meeting notes from today:
*New person at the reception* - Andrea (in the morning and for the student support team, Raul will be there in the afternoon)

*New creative stuff at the campus* - in the innovation space (art on the glass mirrors, new furnitures, whiteboards for post-its, and dividers to separate during meetings) with collaboration from GFT (sponsor, same person from the wine event), and so there should be more events happening in the innovation space

*_Technical updates_*
*Internet* - Thursday until today the internet is fine, changed antennas in rooms 4 and 5

*Microphones* - We can't use more hand microphones because the infrastrucure does not support more mics. Hopefully by the end of this month, we'd have the ceiling microphones.

Reminder about attendance and open cameras - feedback that students that are online are not participating, but to have the cameras on it can be helpful to notice the students who have doubts or issues.

Mobile World Congress - update soon to have the information and share with the students. Mobile is the biggest congress (4 years from now, is one of the halls in the congress)

There will be a poll launched at the end of the program (General Program Survey https://forms.office.com/e/pRrZY3y4qi), and UB has asked for an 80% answer rate, a link will be sent on the weekly update in the student space.
https://www.gft.com/es/es/

Demo day, each of the masters will present on the same day

Graduation is on the 13th of July, in the afternoon around 6pm usually a plus 1 event

Coffee Machines haven't been approved yet, and there is no provision right now.
