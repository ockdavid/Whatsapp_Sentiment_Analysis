10/25/22, 20:36 - Leonie Kettler: ⛵️ *boat trip together* ⛵️

Hey everyone!!
As the first few weeks in Barcelona and at university have passed, we thought it would be nice to all get together and spend an afternoon/evening doing something fun.🥳🥳
Our proposal: Who would be up for a boat trip on Saturday, 5th November? We would start at the harbour in Barcelona at about 3pm and do a 3h boat trip. ☀️
We can be up to 80 people. Depending on the rate we choose (incl./excl. drinks and/or food), the price per person varies between 25€ and 45€.
We are happy to organize something but would therefore need some feedback from you guys.🤗
Or do you have any other suggestions?🍻
10/25/22, 20:37 - Kathryn Nicolson: <Media omitted>

11/2/22, 20:32 - Sebastian Vila: At night
11/2/22, 20:32 - Sebastian Vila: We can do boat during the day
11/2/22, 20:45 - Leonie Kettler: I’m afraid the 18 people interested isn’t enough for the boat trip… (we’d need at least 35 people for the 40€ optional / double the amount for the cheaper option) 😕

I also talked to Mayra. In general BTS has some budget to support us with events like that but only after we have selected the master delegates. So maybe we should try to organize something asap after Friday?☺️
11/2/22, 20:56 - david: If anyone is still interested, we can go for a boat tour with this company. It costs 10 euros per hour
The boat visits 9 places during the hour.

11/3/22, 13:03 - +56 9 9828 0539: 🙋🏽‍♂️Hello BTS friends, I hope you doing great today. 
So, I guess everybody is on a final project for the master. I was wondering how we can collaborate, I think there is a huge value and opportunity between us. Maybe someone will need some help from UX designers or Big Data specialists, etc. I hope we can have a space to make this happen. Open to ideas and comments. Hey ho, let`s go!
11/3/22, 13:06 - Krishanu Roy: Open to collaborate! ✌🏽
11/3/22, 13:10 - Ottavio Italia: Very nice idea! I’m in!
11/3/22, 13:13 - Onassis Nottage: If anyones ready to start a business afterwards I’m up to collaborating as well. We can definitely utilize our nationalities to gain funding from our respective countries. For instance in the Bahamas we have a small business development center where you can pitch ideas and gain funding around up to $500k, if other countries can do this we can easily get a million with 5 persons on a team or something

12/18/22, 11:33 - Saskia: Okay plan B
12/18/22, 11:41 - Saskia: I can host at mine but that means we have to watch the game in Dutch unless someone has an account of some sort to watch on a smart TV

12/18/22, 11:56 - Alessio: I was going to propose my apt (actually very close to George Payne) but I have the same problem
12/18/22, 11:57 - Alessio: We would have to connect RTVE to the smart tv to watch it in Spanish
12/18/22, 11:57 - Alessio: And in English, no idea
12/18/22, 12:00 - Simone Marigliano: Maybe we could check some streaming and stream it on the tv
12/18/22, 12:00 - Saskia: Those technical specs go far beyond my level of understanding 😂 
Eelco said he can Chromecast the game but that ll be in Dutch (Fine by me) but if anyone has an option to watch in Spanish I guess we can try 😊
12/18/22, 12:02 - Alessio: Oh yeah, Spanish tv has the game
12/18/22, 12:03 - david: I can try to help with technical issues 🤙🏼
12/18/22, 12:22 - Saskia: Nice one guys, we’ll make it work! 
Bring your booze and snacks and see you from 3pm.
