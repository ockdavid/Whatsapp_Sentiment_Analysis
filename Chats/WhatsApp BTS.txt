10/25/22, 20:36 - Leonie Kettler: ⛵️ *boat trip together* ⛵️

Hey everyone!!
As the first few weeks in Barcelona and at university have passed, we thought it would be nice to all get together and spend an afternoon/evening doing something fun.🥳🥳
Our proposal: Who would be up for a boat trip on Saturday, 5th November? We would start at the harbour in Barcelona at about 3pm and do a 3h boat trip. ☀️
We can be up to 80 people. Depending on the rate we choose (incl./excl. drinks and/or food), the price per person varies between 25€ and 45€.
We are happy to organize something but would therefore need some feedback from you guys.🤗
Or do you have any other suggestions?🍻

11/2/22, 20:32 - Sebastian Vila: At night
11/2/22, 20:32 - Sebastian Vila: We can do boat during the day
11/2/22, 20:45 - Leonie Kettler: I’m afraid the 18 people interested isn’t enough for the boat trip… (we’d need at least 35 people for the 40€ optional / double the amount for the cheaper option) 😕

I also talked to Mayra. In general BTS has some budget to support us with events like that but only after we have selected the master delegates. So maybe we should try to organize something asap after Friday?☺️
11/2/22, 20:56 - david: If anyone is still interested, we can go for a boat tour with this company. It costs 10 euros per hour
The boat visits 9 places during the hour.

11/3/22, 13:03 - +56 9 9828 0539: 🙋🏽‍♂️Hello BTS friends, I hope you doing great today. 
So, I guess everybody is on a final project for the master. I was wondering how we can collaborate, I think there is a huge value and opportunity between us. Maybe someone will need some help from UX designers or Big Data specialists, etc. I hope we can have a space to make this happen. Open to ideas and comments. Hey ho, let`s go!
11/3/22, 13:06 - Krishanu Roy: Open to collaborate! ✌🏽
11/3/22, 13:10 - Ottavio Oludovisi: Very nice idea! I’m in!
11/3/22, 13:13 - Onassis Nottage: If anyones ready to start a business afterwards I’m up to collaborating as well. We can definitely utilize our nationalities to gain funding from our respective countries. For instance in the Bahamas we have a small business development center where you can pitch ideas and gain funding around up to $500k, if other countries can do this we can easily get a million with 5 persons on a team or something
11/3/22, 13:13 - +56 9 9828 0539: I don`t know the how... is it a meeting, a platform, a wall, a place, a happy hour, an hour, a day, a methodology...
11/3/22, 13:13 - Onassis Nottage: I also just got my TIE 🥹🥹🥹
11/3/22, 13:17 - Ruben Tak: Next tattoo
11/3/22, 13:17 - Krishanu Roy: I think those interested can get together, understand what each of us are working on first. Then see what we can bring to the table.
11/3/22, 13:19 - Krishanu Roy: Open to suggestions ✌🏽
11/3/22, 13:22 - +56 9 9828 0539: bring your clues
11/3/22, 13:27 - +56 9 9828 0539: I mean, we are an ecosystem of abundance, u know...

11/3/22, 13:29 - david: In Japanese

11/8/22, 21:56 - Juliana: Hola beautiful people! My birthday is coming up and I want to celebrate it outside with a potluck style picnic. It looks like Friday afternoon we will have great weather. I was thinking we could meet at the Parc de la Ciutadella after class, around 1/2 pm? If you can bring blankets and food/drinks from your country to share :). 
❤️

Looks like it’s either George Payne that charges 20€ entry now or Ovella Marina but might be difficult to get in..

12/18/22, 11:24 - Saskia: Hahahahahha yeah saw that one coming 😂😂😂
12/18/22, 11:33 - Saskia: Okay plan B
12/18/22, 11:41 - Saskia: I can host at mine but that means we have to watch the game in Dutch unless someone has an account of some sort to watch on a smart TV
12/18/22, 11:42 - +56 9 9828 0539: See you in arch de triunf…🏆
12/18/22, 11:47 - Gabriel: Im down 😄

12/18/22, 11:56 - Alessio: I was going to propose my apt (actually very close to George Payne) but I have the same problem
12/18/22, 11:57 - Alessio: We would have to connect RTVE to the smart tv to watch it in Spanish
12/18/22, 11:57 - Alessio: And in English, no idea
12/18/22, 11:59 - Simone Marigliano: Maybe we could check some streaming and stream it on the tv
12/18/22, 12:00 - Saskia: Those technical specs go far beyond my level of understanding 😂 
Eelco said he can Chromecast the game but that ll be in Dutch (Fine by me) but if anyone has an option to watch in Spanish I guess we can try 😊
12/18/22, 12:02 - Alessio: Oh yeah, Spanish tv has the game
12/18/22, 12:03 - david: I can try to help with technical issues 🤙🏼
12/18/22, 12:22 - Saskia: Nice one guys, we’ll make it work! 
Bring your booze and snacks and see you from 3pm.

1/26/23, 17:29 - Vicky: Can’t do Sat but maybe Sunday
1/26/23, 17:33 - Alessio: Actually Sunday (or even a weekday) might be better because Saturday may be full. They don't take reservations for bowling, you have to go there and write your name on a sheet and wait for them to call you when it's your turn.
Like we were there on Tuesday and we had to wait 1h to play
1/26/23, 17:34 - Alessio: They have bar and restaurant though

2/23/23, 16:22 - Juliana: Already been there ;)
2/23/23, 16:22 - Alessio: However if you have to pick 4 of those, I would say, Valencia, Granada, Porto and Santiago

2/23/23, 16:23 - Juliana: Thanks
2/23/23, 16:23 - Alessio: So you have the chance to visit both on one trip
2/23/23, 18:38 - Unknown 1: Dont go in summer to ronda, literal boiler, but really pretty specially the bridge

3/17/23, 15:11 - Joseph: <Media omitted>
3/17/23, 15:11 - Joseph: Hey guys! I'm running Barcelona Marathon this Sunday and the cheers are always a huge booost.

Here are my estimate time ranges for each area in the map if you're not super hangover and wanna come and cheer. 

You could also *live track* that day to have a better estimate using *Zurich Marato App*, entering my Bib Number: *6295*.

To calculate other areas, my estimated pace hopefully will be between 4:15 (if things are great) and 4:30 (if things are ok) minutes per kilometer.

Here is the app link to track live: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sportmaniac_live_app_android.marato_bcn&hl=en&gl=US

It would be great boooooooost seeing you! Have a great weekend :)
