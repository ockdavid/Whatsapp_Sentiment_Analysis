10/11/22, 16:54 - david: Can you ask if the club is gonna be open tomorrow?
10/11/22, 18:40 - david: I just talked with Sergio, he said 2 things:

1. Statistical Foundations and Artificial Intelligence are the most "academic courses". It means they're like a university course because of its content. BUT the subjects that we see in statistics we we'll see them again in others courses, so don't worry if you didn't understand everything the first day. We will see the subjects again.

2. The first day of the project course on November 29th (he said the date will change maybe) we will see the past projects, how we're going to  work, we're going to set up the groups, etc. So don't worry about it and just enjoy the city.
10/11/22, 18:55 - Ottavio Italia: Thanks!!!

10/20/22, 17:01 - Ottavio Italia: It took me a total of 9 hours to do the assignment
10/20/22, 17:01 - Ottavio Italia: 🙃
10/20/22, 17:05 - Ruben Tak: :,)
10/20/22, 17:05 - Ruben Tak: I’m in Spain but the s is silent..
10/20/22, 17:13 - Onassis Nottage: Kml
10/20/22, 17:13 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
10/20/22, 17:26 - Ottavio Italia: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 17:29 - Ruben Tak: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 19:41 - Gabriel Rennó: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 19:42 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
10/20/22, 19:44 - Ottavio Italia: Ahahahahhaha
10/20/22, 21:34 - david: *-Which is the mean alcohol consumption per continent for every column entry? -*
This is asking for total_litres_of_pure_alcohol? Or the mean of all the columns?
10/20/22, 21:35 - Onassis Nottage: I used the total litres column
10/20/22, 21:35 - david: I think that column is the result of the 3 columns that are next to it, right?
10/20/22, 21:35 - Ottavio Italia: I don’t know he asks for every column entry
10/20/22, 21:36 - Ottavio Italia: I outputted all columns
10/20/22, 21:36 - Ottavio Italia: To me it seemed he asked for all of em
10/20/22, 21:36 - david: Yea, that confuses me
10/20/22, 21:38 - Onassis Nottage: How much points is this?
10/20/22, 21:38 - david: 10
10/20/22, 21:39 - Ottavio Italia: In a way yes but since it’s not a direct sum I wouldn’t say it’s the same thing to only use that
10/20/22, 21:39 - Onassis Nottage: 😪
10/20/22, 21:39 - david: I'll write both answers
10/20/22, 21:40 - Onassis Nottage: Let me take a look at this
10/20/22, 21:40 - Onassis Nottage: Right
10/20/22, 22:03 - Onassis Nottage: And for the brave ones:
10/20/22, 22:03 - Onassis Nottage: Is that a bonus?
10/20/22, 22:03 - david: Nope
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: Why'd he label it like it was?
10/20/22, 22:04 - Ottavio Italia: Because you actually need to be brave
10/20/22, 22:04 - Ottavio Italia: At least I had to
10/20/22, 22:04 - Ottavio Italia: 🥲
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: I really didn't want to look back a the other questions
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: I solved it
10/20/22, 22:04 - david: Because if you can't do it you should feel bad because you are not a brave one
10/20/22, 22:04 - Onassis Nottage: So I didn't really care if this was right or wrong
10/20/22, 22:04 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:05 - Onassis Nottage: I'm aware of the points lol, but are the points optional is what I'm asking
10/20/22, 22:05 - Ottavio Italia: Honestly if he counts it as wrong I’ll say that it wasn’t very clear
10/20/22, 22:05 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, I'm not interested in this homework anymore
10/20/22, 22:05 - Onassis Nottage: I've looked at this too much
10/20/22, 22:05 - Ottavio Italia: I mean it won’t change much, I don’t think grades matter a lot but still
10/20/22, 22:05 - david: The sum is 100 points including the last part
10/20/22, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: I answered everything lol, I'm just don't believe we need to overthink what he's asking
10/20/22, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: The instructions should've been more clearer
10/20/22, 22:07 - Ottavio Italia: I agree, we all could go back but meh
10/20/22, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: Lol I appreciate you
10/20/22, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: I know exactly how you feel about this
10/20/22, 22:07 - david: Don't worry, it's only 30%
10/20/22, 22:07 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:07 - david: 40*%
10/20/22, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: Didn't this change?
10/20/22, 22:08 - david: Waaaait
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: He kept talking about it in class
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: I can't remember what each one is now though
10/20/22, 22:08 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: There we go
10/20/22, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: That's it
10/20/22, 22:08 - david: I think that's the right one
10/20/22, 22:09 - david: 🫠
10/20/22, 22:09 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaoo
10/20/22, 22:09 - Onassis Nottage: "C's get degrees"
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: Ohhhh
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: Wait
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: @393663863107 if it's out of 100
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: We could still not give a shit about that question
10/20/22, 22:10 - Onassis Nottage: Because it's 90% if everything else is right
10/20/22, 22:35 - Onassis Nottage: Including total liters of pure alcohol?
10/20/22, 22:39 - Ottavio Italia: Yep
10/20/22, 22:39 - Ottavio Italia: Yes i just dont think its smart to give confusing instruction to people that have to face problems they never encountered before
10/20/22, 22:39 - Onassis Nottage: Alright
10/20/22, 22:40 - Onassis Nottage: "That's the life of a data scientist"
10/20/22, 22:40 - Ottavio Italia: I mean i know its not what he wanted to do
10/20/22, 22:40 - Onassis Nottage: I'm sure that would be a response
10/20/22, 22:40 - Ottavio Italia: One would think
10/20/22, 22:40 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, I think we should petition that one to be a bonus, because it's really confusing
10/20/22, 22:41 - Ottavio Italia: I woul send him an email but im too tired, maybe ill send one tomomrrow
10/20/22, 22:41 - david: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 22:42 - david: I'm more confuse than one hour ago
10/20/22, 22:42 - Onassis Nottage: We have no idea
10/20/22, 22:42 - Onassis Nottage: I wrote multiple answers
10/20/22, 22:42 - david: Just in case
10/20/22, 22:42 - david: I'll do it now, maybe tomorrow is answering
10/20/22, 22:43 - Onassis Nottage: I grouped by continent, aggregated by mean, and sorted the values in one answer
10/20/22, 22:43 - Onassis Nottage: Then I made an entirely new column that has the average of each row for another answer
10/20/22, 23:23 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
10/20/22, 23:24 - Onassis Nottage: I thought it was because of my laptop screen, but I'm on a monitor now and it's showing the same thing
10/20/22, 23:24 - david: After 3-4 hours I couldnt but Miguel told me that it doesn't matter
10/20/22, 23:25 - Onassis Nottage: Say less, thanks
10/20/22, 23:25 - Onassis Nottage: I guess I'm officially done with this
10/20/22, 23:32 - Onassis Nottage: Just turned mine in
10/20/22, 23:33 - Onassis Nottage: I'm heading to bed
10/21/22, 11:44 - Gabriel Rennó: <Media omitted>
10/21/22, 18:13 - Onassis Nottage: Anyone out now?
10/21/22, 18:13 - Onassis Nottage: Or want to go out before this thing at 9?
10/21/22, 18:14 - Joseph México: I'd be down to drink a beer in a park/beach or something more casual
10/21/22, 18:14 - Onassis Nottage: Let’s do it!
10/21/22, 18:14 - Onassis Nottage: Pregame
10/21/22, 18:14 - Joseph México: Warm-up
10/21/22, 18:14 - Onassis Nottage: Just send the location if you have a place in mind
10/21/22, 18:15 - david: Wanna go to this place?
10/21/22, 18:15 - david: La Pecera del Pool

10/21/22, 18:15 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure what you sent but I’m down lol
10/21/22, 18:15 - Onassis Nottage: We can meet there if you want
10/21/22, 18:16 - Onassis Nottage: It’ll take me 30 minutes to get there, @4915750950176 you want to go?
10/21/22, 18:17 - david: I'm be there in 30-40 min
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: Just wanted to confirm before I leave since it takes a while for me to get there
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: Cool
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: @995555481144 see you there bro!
10/21/22, 18:17 - Onassis Nottage: First round is on me
10/21/22, 18:18 - Onassis Nottage: Unless you’re somewhere else? 👀
10/21/22, 18:18 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah I will be there at around 9
10/21/22, 18:18 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: We can continue somewhere after this ! 🤟
10/21/22, 18:19 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Do you plan at Nevermind Bar?
10/21/22, 18:20 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I am finishing DS assignment 😬
10/21/22, 18:21 - Joseph México: Probably see you at nevermind at 930~
10/21/22, 18:21 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah I’ll be there
10/21/22, 18:21 - Onassis Nottage: Alright
10/21/22, 18:22 - Onassis Nottage: I just finished everything else and don’t have anything to do till then lol
10/21/22, 18:22 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Okay then see you there !
10/21/22, 18:25 - david: Damn, I forgot to send it 😂
10/21/22, 18:25 - david: I was busy with the documents and the TIE appointment
10/21/22, 18:25 - david: Finally I'm done with that
10/21/22, 18:27 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I think last one is also incorrect
10/21/22, 18:28 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Cause there are countries with 0-s in wine beer and spirit and in PIE chart it is as Beer, I think it must be None
10/21/22, 18:29 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
10/21/22, 18:30 - david: With my solution I got the same result as the professor
10/21/22, 18:30 - david: 🫡
10/21/22, 18:30 - Onassis Nottage: You have to set those to np.nan when that’s the case
10/21/22, 18:33 - Ottavio Italia: Yeah just add a second condition to every function line that states the value must be >0
10/21/22, 18:34 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah but if I put them as Nan thr result will be like this
10/21/22, 18:35 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: beer 101, spirit 59, Wine 20 and None 13
10/21/22, 18:35 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Professor says Beer 114
10/21/22, 18:35 - Onassis Nottage: No, np.nan
10/21/22, 18:35 - Ottavio Italia: Because he counted beers when it NaN
10/21/22, 18:35 - Onassis Nottage: When you set it to this, the plot doesn’t include null values
10/21/22, 18:37 - Onassis Nottage: @34695128762 should I leave now?
10/21/22, 18:42 - david: I'll be there in 30
10/21/22, 18:42 - david: I'm just checking the hw before submitte it
10/21/22, 18:56 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: You are going to the pool right? And after this at nevermind?
10/21/22, 18:57 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
10/21/22, 19:03 - Onassis Nottage: I wanted to pregame before the party
10/21/22, 19:03 - Onassis Nottage: Because I have to be up pretty early tomorrow
10/21/22, 19:06 - david: To study the whole day
10/21/22, 19:06 - Onassis Nottage: Nah, that was today
10/21/22, 19:06 - Onassis Nottage: Last week Friday our teacher decided to have class
10/21/22, 19:06 - Onassis Nottage: So Saturday became study day
10/21/22, 19:07 - Gabriel Rennó: Are you guys going to the bar that the ppl said in the group?
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: This is the location
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: If you want to come
10/21/22, 19:13 - david: To nevermind? I'll go
10/21/22, 19:13 - Onassis Nottage: Oh that, yeah I’m going after this
10/21/22, 19:18 - david: Did you get to the bar?
10/21/22, 19:18 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
10/21/22, 19:19 - david: I'll be there in a second

10/22/22, 01:19 - david: Not me bro
10/22/22, 01:19 - david: Amos told me you left
10/22/22, 01:19 - Onassis Nottage: Oh, I didn’t see you at all lol, I thought you left
10/22/22, 01:29 - david: Not bro I'm still here
10/22/22, 01:31 - Onassis Nottage: I have to wake up so early tomorrow 😪
10/22/22, 01:32 - david: But you're still awake
10/22/22, 01:35 - Onassis Nottage: I just got home

10/22/22, 12:58 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Did you like it?
10/22/22, 12:58 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah it was really informative and lively
10/22/22, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: They had booths of different companies that were in either tourism, education or immigration categories
10/22/22, 12:59 - Onassis Nottage: I networked with a lady that used artists NFTs in augmented reality throughout Barcelona
10/22/22, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: Basically artists create virtual art, and you can explore through the areas looking for them
10/22/22, 13:00 - Onassis Nottage: Almost like Pokémon Go, but with art
10/22/22, 13:02 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah I have heard of it, there are like digital artist shows where you just by ticket online and review the paintings in  digital space - so the world is really going digital in many parts
10/22/22, 13:02 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I think if you told the man 20 years ago that he can review paintings with VR in digital, he will take you as mad 😀
10/22/22, 13:03 - Onassis Nottage: Yes, it’s really cool
10/22/22, 13:03 - Onassis Nottage: 😂😂😂 exactly
10/22/22, 16:10 - Joseph México: Is anyone still going?

11/3/22, 14:56 - Ruben Tak: Wait
11/3/22, 14:56 - Gabriel Rennó: Because i cant put two left joins with the same column
11/3/22, 14:56 - Gabriel Rennó: Table*
11/3/22, 14:57 - Ruben Tak: <Media omitted>
11/3/22, 14:57 - Ottavio Italia: You can, you just have to rename them differently and join them on different columns
11/3/22, 14:58 - Ruben Tak: the where statement
11/3/22, 14:58 - Gabriel Rennó: Nice
11/3/22, 14:58 - Gabriel Rennó: I was missing this part of renaming them differently

11/3/22, 15:42 - Ottavio Italia: Hey guys, I had changed the dtype through the modify table menu in sqlite, but while trying to do the same by coding I can’t seem to make it work
11/3/22, 15:43 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_cast.asp
11/3/22, 15:44 - Ottavio Italia: I’m using this exact syntax but it doesn’t seem to work
11/3/22, 15:45 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: ,CAST("altitude" AS INT) as airport_altitude
11/3/22, 15:45 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: this one works
11/3/22, 15:51 - Ottavio Italia: Still something broken
11/3/22, 15:52 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Can you share the code ?
11/3/22, 15:54 - Ottavio Italia: <Media omitted>
11/3/22, 15:54 - Ottavio Italia: i tried with "altitude" too but it fill the column with 0s
11/3/22, 15:55 - Ottavio Italia: Its just easier to change the dtype through the menu but im guesing thats not what he wants
11/3/22, 17:00 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Once again, so @12428076373  what do you think ?
11/3/22, 17:01 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I  can do it as well - but as I said before my vote is for Onassis.
11/3/22, 17:01 - Joseph México: I think is fine
11/3/22, 17:01 - Onassis Nottage: I’m okay with it, if that’s what the majority wants

11/4/22, 10:12 - Onassis Nottage: Let me hear your thoughts, if you started?
11/4/22, 10:13 - Onassis Nottage: If the file isn't in the list of names he sent, I just let it send a note to say it's not in the list and will call it a day...
11/4/22, 10:14 - david: Not yet
11/4/22, 10:14 - david: But this is good
11/4/22, 10:14 - Ottavio Italia: Honestly i still dont have a clue how to properly write .py files, i sent him a mail asking where i can study for it couse i cant seem to find a proper tutorial
11/4/22, 10:14 - Ottavio Italia: But ofc he didnt answer
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: I just copy everything I did in the notebook and put it in the file
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: I test it out with input()
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: And then replace input with sys.argv[1]
11/4/22, 10:15 - Ottavio Italia: I dont think thats fair, tahnks a lot tho
11/4/22, 10:15 - Onassis Nottage: So it'll work in the shell
11/4/22, 10:15 - david: Are you using jupyter notebook?
11/4/22, 10:16 - Ottavio Italia: Im trying to run it in the terminal, but the point i cant get across is the logic of the code itself
11/4/22, 10:17 - david: You can write your code on a notepad and save it with the .py like file.py and it is a py file
11/4/22, 10:17 - david: And what you write there is the same as a notebook
11/4/22, 10:18 - david: I can explain you after the My digital impact
11/4/22, 10:19 - Gabriel Rennó: <Media omitted>

11/4/22, 10:27 - Joseph México: you should haha but I mean, maybe there is something I can adjust, i just havent find it
11/4/22, 10:27 - Ottavio Italia: Im the last person who can help you out i fear
11/4/22, 10:44 - Onassis Nottage: It's because of the path to your file
11/4/22, 10:44 - Onassis Nottage: This time we're not using an actual path, so you have to move to the directory of your py file
11/4/22, 10:45 - Onassis Nottage: Lmao
11/4/22, 10:45 - Joseph México: So it's "okay"
11/4/22, 10:45 - david: Looks like create_db it's not a python file
11/4/22, 10:46 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah

11/7/22, 16:39 - Ottavio Italia: Ahahahaaha
11/7/22, 16:52 - Joseph México: What is the probability that we will get more last minute notice from stadistics?
11/7/22, 16:52 - Ottavio Italia: Lets plot it
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: We have like 3 more classes left
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: And only what? Two were in person? Lol
11/7/22, 16:53 - Joseph México: do you know if Ankit is teaching any other courses?
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: So far
11/7/22, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: Big data something
11/7/22, 16:54 - Joseph México: fuck
11/7/22, 16:54 - Onassis Nottage: Or advanced data science?
11/7/22, 16:54 - Onassis Nottage: One of the two
11/7/22, 16:54 - Joseph México: can we request a another teacher?
11/7/22, 16:54 - Ruben Tak: @ class representative
11/7/22, 16:55 - Joseph México: I mean, I guess we can, but Idk if I am the only one that would want that
11/7/22, 16:55 - Ottavio Italia: Harsh but I agree
11/7/22, 16:55 - Onassis Nottage: If the majority wants a new one, I’ll march in the streets till we do
11/7/22, 16:55 - Ottavio Italia: 🎉
11/7/22, 16:56 - Ottavio Italia: I think he’s super nice, I just don’t think we learned much yet and his method seems a bit off to me
11/7/22, 16:56 - Joseph México: i would talk with Daria to see what are the options, i am not happy with the class itself and even less with so many remote/missing clases
11/7/22, 16:56 - Joseph México: i mean, he is nice, I like him, he would be my friend, but idk if my teacher
11/7/22, 16:57 - Onassis Nottage: I agree
11/7/22, 16:57 - Gabriel Rennó: maybe we can suggest them to hire a teacher who actually teaches
11/7/22, 16:57 - Ottavio Italia: Savage
11/7/22, 16:57 - Onassis Nottage: Lol
11/7/22, 16:58 - Joseph México: agree
11/7/22, 16:58 - Onassis Nottage: I just don’t see much of a correlation between what he teaches and what we should know/ be prepared for in the real world
11/7/22, 16:59 - Onassis Nottage: I studied math myself and no job is going to ask me to find a hypergeometric distribution
11/7/22, 16:59 - Onassis Nottage: At least not the ones I worked for
11/7/22, 16:59 - Ottavio Italia: Was about to say you have a degree in mathematics
11/7/22, 16:59 - Onassis Nottage: No case studies, or anything
11/7/22, 16:59 - Ottavio Italia: Which I think strengthens the statement
11/7/22, 16:59 - david: Same here
11/7/22, 17:00 - Onassis Nottage: I get what he’s trying to do, but there’s no way to accomplish that in this short timeframe with this diverse group
11/7/22, 17:00 - Onassis Nottage: The best solution is case studies to see where to apply different things
11/7/22, 17:01 - david: He's just following the idea of the course: "statistics"
11/7/22, 17:02 - Gabriel Rennó: I mean, i feel like i didnt learn *anything* from this class
11/7/22, 17:02 - Ruben Tak: A man of the people 🤝
11/7/22, 17:02 - Ottavio Italia: He said: “try and apply these concepts to databases you find”
Yeah ok
11/7/22, 17:02 - Gabriel Rennó: And we are paying for that
11/7/22, 17:02 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaooooo
11/7/22, 17:03 - Gabriel Rennó: So it kind of sucks
11/7/22, 17:03 - Onassis Nottage: We can do this if you want?
11/7/22, 17:03 - Onassis Nottage: I can find something on Kaggle
11/7/22, 17:03 - david: Because we don't learn like Hindus do
11/7/22, 17:03 - Onassis Nottage: But I just figured no one would’ve cared about that extra assignment
11/7/22, 17:03 - Ottavio Italia: Honestly it doesn’t help if I’m randomly plotting correlation heatmaps
11/7/22, 17:04 - Ottavio Italia: What we are doing with DSF is at least pointing towards a case study
11/7/22, 17:04 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, I actually liked the last class though, when he took us through the court system data and hypothesis testing
11/7/22, 17:04 - Joseph México: i think there is not much we can do for this course (hopefully there is), but what I suggest is to talk to Daria to prevent this for future courses, e.g. Big Data whatever, advanced balh blah
11/7/22, 17:05 - Joseph México: if the majority agrees
11/7/22, 17:05 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah I really don’t want this to be theoretical if that’s the only big data class we’ll have for the program
11/7/22, 17:07 - Gabriel Rennó: agree
11/7/22, 17:07 - david: Ankit is gonna teach us (hopefully not) big data infrastructure
11/7/22, 17:08 - david: That scares me because at least I know a little bit of statistics
11/7/22, 17:08 - david: But Big Data Infrastructure sounds like the core of this master
11/7/22, 17:10 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah we’d be half dead in there and that’s the major portion lol
11/7/22, 17:14 - Joseph México: I have created this form so we can vote on this 🙂 https://forms.gle/bhVpTrURsKF4prJa7
It´s asking for emails, just so we dont have duplicated answers
11/7/22, 17:14 - Joseph México: Please fill, there is also a "i dont mind" option if you dont care
11/7/22, 17:15 - david: Done
11/7/22, 17:18 - Amos: Done
11/7/22, 17:21 - Ruben Tak: I voted for a new one, but I was wondering if we shouldn’t inform him about the problem first as well, as we now in a way will go over his head without informing him how we feel. Chances are ofcourse then that he will make promises to improve and there will not be looked for a new teacher
11/7/22, 17:22 - Ruben Tak: Just to speak my mind
11/7/22, 17:22 - Ottavio Italia: Actually I agree with this, he seems very willing to do better, perhaps we owe him that
11/7/22, 17:23 - Joseph México: I think we already did, a couple of times, but we can do it once more
11/7/22, 17:23 - Joseph México: i think we have done it a couple of times, maybe we havent been clear neither on what we want/expect
11/7/22, 17:24 - Joseph México: but sure, let´s speak our mind to him
11/7/22, 17:25 - Ruben Tak: But we as the students are the customers at the end of the day, we should try to make our time here of the highest quality as possible, despite the emotions that might get involved
11/7/22, 17:25 - david: He is kind of trying, that's why the last class was "better"
11/7/22, 17:26 - Ruben Tak: Let’s do it with daria as well in the conversation to make this process as short as possible
11/7/22, 17:26 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: So maybe tomorrows lecture can be last chance? I mean
He is doing remote - he knows
He needs to do good job to keep us motivated, more than in the class - if the studying style would be different, I think we should talk to Daria and be very clear.
11/7/22, 17:27 - Ruben Tak: Yeah but let’s inform him about it now, so he has some time to change some last things if he feels like he needs to
11/7/22, 17:27 - Joseph México: you mean by email?
11/7/22, 17:27 - david: Talk with both at the same time is better so Anki will notice that we're really worry about this
11/7/22, 17:28 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I know that it will be the same, but I agree with Ruben, we should speak with him as well.
11/7/22, 17:28 - david: @12428076373 💪🏼
11/7/22, 17:29 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: So how do you think would be better to describe our pain? 😅
11/7/22, 17:29 - Ruben Tak: I think? 😅
11/7/22, 17:30 - Ruben Tak: I think we should make a customer journey map
11/7/22, 17:30 - Joseph México: agree
11/7/22, 17:31 - david: Let's plot the results with Tableau
11/7/22, 17:32 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Guys, find something for skills maping
11/7/22, 17:33 - Gabriel Rennó: I agree that we as customers from bts have all the right to be upset with the service
11/7/22, 17:33 - Gabriel Rennó: So we should let daria or whoever know it asap
11/7/22, 17:35 - Joseph México: I´d say talk with him tomorrow and with Daria in parallel, just saying what we feel, as for now 50% (7/7 votes) want a new teacher, so it´s not a small concern
11/7/22, 17:35 - Joseph México: let´s speak to both, so either he can improve but at the same time for BTS to start thinking about possible solutions before we are down the wire
11/7/22, 17:37 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: *8/8
11/7/22, 17:44 - david: Probably I'm going to the school tomorrow so I can call Daria to join us

11/8/22, 16:49 - Ottavio Italia: Done
11/8/22, 16:49 - Ottavio Italia: Password is the same or did we get a code I didn’t see?
11/8/22, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: You have to sign up on your own I think?
11/8/22, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: But make sure to use the BTS email
11/8/22, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: I can’t remember what I did
11/8/22, 16:57 - Ottavio Italia: Ok it was obviously sent to spam, thanks a lot tho!

11/8/22, 21:20 - Ottavio Italia: Coming with him
11/8/22, 21:21 - Onassis Nottage: Sounds like you’re not coming at all then
11/8/22, 21:25 - Ottavio Italia: Damn you’re right
11/8/22, 21:32 - david: @393663863107 is coming because he saw this
11/8/22, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: I appreciate this lecturer though
11/8/22, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: The classes may not be “perfect” but she’s doing a pretty good job at providing us with networking opportunities
11/8/22, 22:07 - Ottavio Italia: So good, I agree
11/8/22, 22:08 - Ottavio Italia: Dude you promised you wouldn’t tell
11/8/22, 22:16 - david: <Media omitted>
11/9/22, 12:15 - Onassis Nottage: Just an update everyone, I spoke with Daria before I left about Statistics
11/9/22, 12:16 - Onassis Nottage: She said next week we can all meet and discuss if you’d like
11/9/22, 12:16 - david: Sure
11/9/22, 12:16 - Onassis Nottage: If not just share your concerns if you haven’t done so already and I’ll talk about them
11/9/22, 12:16 - Onassis Nottage: Daria is also asking for us to fill out this survey so they can know if you want to attend or not
11/9/22, 12:31 - Gabriel Rennó: I would go
11/9/22, 12:45 - Joseph México: I'm down
11/9/22, 12:46 - Onassis Nottage: Update
11/9/22, 12:46 - Onassis Nottage: It’ll be tomorrow

11/9/22, 13:46 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
11/9/22, 15:53 - Ottavio Italia: Has anyone started the assignment for DSF?

11/9/22, 15:58 - Joseph México: But different ids
11/9/22, 15:59 - Ottavio Italia: Couse I got this
11/9/22, 15:59 - Ottavio Italia: <Media omitted>
11/9/22, 17:35 - Gabriel Rennó: I think you should use theme id
11/9/22, 17:35 - Gabriel Rennó: Btw how u guys manage to filter only the top 3 on query4?
11/9/22, 17:35 - Ottavio Italia: Yes! Thanks, joe helped me
11/9/22, 17:36 - Ottavio Italia: Nameofcolumn in (1,2,3)
11/9/22, 17:36 - Ottavio Italia: Where*
11/9/22, 17:37 - Gabriel Rennó: Not working for me
11/9/22, 17:37 - Gabriel Rennó: And do you know how to crate a new table from a query?
11/9/22, 17:37 - Gabriel Rennó: Instead of using “with”

11/10/22, 18:09 - Onassis Nottage: I guess not lol
11/10/22, 18:11 - Onassis Nottage: With q as (query 1),
With r as (query one but 2015)
Select *,
Select r.count(*)
From q
Left join r on r.Id = q.id
11/10/22, 18:11 - Onassis Nottage: Make sure the fields aren’t null
11/10/22, 18:12 - Onassis Nottage: And then something or other

11/18/22, 17:30 - Onassis Nottage: I did at first till I did that
11/18/22, 17:30 - Ottavio Italia: Isn’t the colormap changing the colored image too? Doesn’t that like negate everything else we done?
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph México: Maybe it's not cmd the right parameter haha but something like that
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph México: The thing is that greyscale images dont have colors per se
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph México: Just intensities
11/18/22, 17:31 - Joseph México: So you choose th3 Palette
11/18/22, 17:32 - Ottavio Italia: Makes sense

11/22/22, 12:11 - Onassis Nottage: Definitely
11/22/22, 12:13 - Ruben Tak: But I think I asked before coming here and I was told that we should kind of initiate it ourselves and if there are enough people willing to go we can
11/22/22, 12:13 - Ruben Tak: Maybe ask daria or Sergio

11/22/22, 14:14 - Onassis Nottage: *Masters Delegate Meeting - Tuesday November 22, 2022*
*Attendance:*
Daria (Coordinator)
Mayra (Coordinator)
Saskia (Delegate UX)
Ghandi (Delegate PM)
Leonie (Delegate DTM)
Onassis (Delegate BDAI)


*Notes:*

*Delegate meetings* - This space is to allow inclusive and human centered approach to share ideas. All meetings will not be recorded, in hopes to feel as a safe space to share any concern. These meetings are to share issues with BTS as a whole, if we need to meet as MBDS, we can ask for a meeting with Sergio and Daria offline.

*Coffee Machine* - They're currently in the process of trying to get an actual vending machine instead of a coffee machine

*Christmas event* - December 16th there will be a wine festival, it's a Christmas event, and we have sommeliers giving us different wine to taste during the experience

*Budgets and allocations* - If we have a collective idea for an event or product, just let me know and we can discuss as delegates to see if we can get backing from as many persons in BTS to get what we need. There is currently not a budget number related, but we can ask for an event with a description in advance, we can recommend an event for all of us in BTS.

*Global Chapters Program* - This is more of an immersion trip as opposed of internships, Daria will discuss to coordinate the trip and it can involve other students in the masters. I've also asked to see if we can raise money for some of the students who would like to go but don't have the funds to do it now.  

*UB Digital Badge* - We will have access to a few of the resources on the UB campus including access to the library by the end of this week. They have the information, but it's in Catalan so they're currently translating the documents to English for us. In the meantime they there are other library spaces they will send and coworking spaces they will list for us in the meantime (it's easy to apply for a library card).

*Wifi Hack* - BTS has different routers, if you're having bad connectivity, you can disconnect and reconnect to the nearest router in BTS

*Universal Microphone* - This term they should have a universal microphone (they're working to resolve the issues as soon as possible). The classroom noise we hear is only happening in our room, the other rooms don't have this issue, and it's only happening for persons who are remotely (not for persons who are online in the classroom).

*Lost and Found* - Any items in the lost and found can be checked by the reception, so if you ever lose anything, you can check there for them
Access to software - We will be using AWS for our Big Data Infrastructure course, and we have access to it for the entire year
11/22/22, 14:15 - Onassis Nottage: Meeting just ended, these were the notes I took. If I get anything else from them, I'll share it in here

11/24/22, 13:47 - Afolabi: Just go to camp nou man. I know they sell match tickets right there. It's just a stop from Zona Universitaria on the tram line. If you're registered as resident in Barcelona, you'll pay less for the ticket

12/2/22, 15:26 - Onassis Nottage: I liked this, although it wasn’t what I was expecting
12/2/22, 15:27 - Onassis Nottage: It was similar to our entrepreneurship class where Ana just gives a list of stuff to send us in the right direction
12/2/22, 15:27 - Joseph México: That's life, welcome
12/2/22, 15:27 - Onassis Nottage: Lol
12/2/22, 23:43 - Ottavio Italia: Who put a smiley face near my name on miro
12/3/22, 15:19 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Hey guys, about bacteria assignment, how you multiplied plot X axis on 5 min? where he says that picture is taken in every 5 min
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Italia: You should use np.linspace
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Italia: You have 30 images so
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Italia: 0,120,30 i think
12/3/22, 15:48 - Ottavio Italia: Then when you reduce the images to 26 it becomes 
0,120,26
12/3/22, 15:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: solved already
12/3/22, 15:49 - Ottavio Italia: Oopsie!
12/3/22, 15:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: just it was so easy and it was taking time :d
12/3/22, 15:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: thank you !
12/3/22, 15:49 - Ottavio Italia: Sorry I was late!
12/3/22, 15:50 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: no worries !
12/3/22, 16:13 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: can someone share how to calculate chi_sq? I am getting different results
12/3/22, 16:14 - david: chi_sq[i] = np.sum((bact_area_wo - theo)**2)
12/4/22, 17:16 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Hey guys, by any chance does anybody know about exact requirements and the process for Work permit in Spain ? Or if you know a lawyer who you can recommend for such cases
12/4/22, 17:27 - david: No idea
12/4/22, 17:42 - Onassis Nottage: Check canvas
12/4/22, 17:42 - Onassis Nottage: There’s a work permit thing in there, and BTS I believe has to be involved
12/4/22, 17:44 - Onassis Nottage: Look at the modules page for everyone, where the job ads are, at the top of that part there should be documents on how to get a work permit
12/4/22, 17:46 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
12/4/22, 17:47 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Thank you ! I will check that
12/4/22, 17:49 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah I think BTS should be involved, have already contacted them
12/4/22, 17:57 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
12/4/22, 17:59 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah for sure,  I  meant with the information and contacts mainly, they must have some previous experience I think.

12/7/22, 17:19 - david: I'm gonna check it in 5 min
12/7/22, 17:28 - Onassis Nottage: Yup
12/7/22, 17:28 - Onassis Nottage: Lol
12/7/22, 17:29 - Ottavio Italia: Like
12/7/22, 17:29 - Ottavio Italia: I don’t think he looked at it
12/7/22, 17:31 - david: Why is it bad?
12/7/22, 17:32 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure
12/7/22, 17:32 - Ottavio Italia: 121 Lines, you lose 10 to missing values, only a couple numerical columns with little to no utility
12/7/22, 17:32 - Ottavio Italia: If you try to plot the price ranges you get a flat distribution couse the data is so little
12/7/22, 17:33 - david: Well yeah
12/7/22, 17:33 - Onassis Nottage: Did you try unplugging and waiting 20 seconds?
12/7/22, 17:33 - Ottavio Italia: If you try with the colors you have so many it’s impossible to get any insight other than:
“ most popular colors are black and white”
12/7/22, 17:33 - Ottavio Italia: ?
12/7/22, 17:34 - david: What else is important besides the price and the size(?=)
12/7/22, 17:34 - david: How life works
12/7/22, 17:37 - Onassis Nottage: Life hack my friend
12/7/22, 17:37 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: This works with everything 😂

12/9/22, 11:51 - Ottavio Italia: Guys i have an emergency I can’t attend the rest of the class (likely) so if ankit asks you know why
12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: So
12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: Ankit for data infra?
12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: Hahahah
12/9/22, 13:03 - Gabriel Rennó: 🫠
12/9/22, 13:03 - Joseph México: 👎🏻
12/9/22, 13:06 - david: I don't think it will be that bad jaja
12/9/22, 13:09 - Joseph México: Is he staying @12428076373 ? Do you know
12/9/22, 13:10 - Onassis Nottage: Well I asked Sergio on the masters call and he said he was getting someone else
12/9/22, 13:11 - david: Maybe they didn't find someone
12/9/22, 13:11 - Onassis Nottage: So when he said this
12/9/22, 13:11 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
12/9/22, 13:11 - david: You were like this
12/9/22, 13:12 - Onassis Nottage: Bey please lol, stop showing me that 🤣🤣🤣
12/9/22, 13:12 - Onassis Nottage: I already erased it from my memory
12/9/22, 13:12 - Gabriel Rennó: Hahahahahahahahah wtf
12/9/22, 13:13 - Onassis Nottage: Lol this is the most messed up sticker I’ve ever seen
12/9/22, 13:13 - david: <Media omitted>
12/9/22, 13:13 - Gabriel Rennó: Exactly 😂😂
12/9/22, 13:13 - Onassis Nottage: But yeah, either that… orrr they haven’t had the heart to tell him he’s not
12/9/22, 13:13 - Gabriel Rennó: Wtf is going on there
12/9/22, 13:14 - Gabriel Rennó: I have so many questions
12/9/22, 13:14 - Onassis Nottage: Oh yeah
12/9/22, 13:14 - Onassis Nottage: https://chat.openai.com/
12/9/22, 13:14 - Onassis Nottage: I forgot to mention this
12/9/22, 13:15 - Onassis Nottage: This is a chatbot that can retain a conversation
12/9/22, 13:15 - david: But I think that the problem was more the subject (statistics) than Ankit
12/9/22, 13:15 - Onassis Nottage: It's super cool to play around with
12/9/22, 13:15 - Gabriel Rennó: This is amazing
12/9/22, 13:15 - david: So I hope that big data infrastructure will be more acceptable
12/9/22, 13:15 - Gabriel Rennó: This and the dalle2
12/9/22, 13:15 - Gabriel Rennó: Gets me scared
12/9/22, 13:15 - Onassis Nottage: Not for me, I was fine with whatever he threw, the problem was no work or assignments, and moving classes to Fridays
12/9/22, 13:16 - Gabriel Rennó: Same
12/9/22, 13:16 - Onassis Nottage: In my undergrad for math, it was more theoretical, and I've still had more practical statistics assignments compared to this class
12/9/22, 13:16 - david: No assignments "because of the subject" according to him
12/9/22, 13:17 - david: Let's pray for the next course
12/9/22, 13:17 - Onassis Nottage: Super easy to blame everyone else
12/9/22, 13:17 - Onassis Nottage: There shouldn't be any theory
12/9/22, 13:17 - Onassis Nottage: But that's not what my issue is; it's more of actually having work to retain the information and practice
12/9/22, 13:19 - Ottavio Italia: Yup

12/12/22, 18:07 - Onassis Nottage: Ahh okay cool

12/14/22, 14:31 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Guys, did data driven business gave us any exact recommendations of what analysis need be done on assignment 2 ? How users of Mac are going to use PowerBI?
12/14/22, 14:46 - Onassis Nottage: I just gave the canvas

12/14/22, 18:36 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm giving him a Jupyter notebook with comments
12/14/22, 18:37 - Ottavio Italia: I sent him a notebook, a power bi dashboard and the data analytics canvas, I’m scared

12/22/22, 11:27 - Andrea Pavelkova: The class is basically Max going "ok so please install 467642 things" and me saying "nothing works"

12/22/22, 11:32 - Onassis Nottage: Roberta should get a whole award for that class
12/22/22, 11:32 - david: The only problem with him is that he doesn't answer mails
12/22/22, 11:32 - Ottavio Italia: Perhaps we should tell Sergio she was very good
12/22/22, 11:32 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Yeah, we should somehow ask for Roberta lectures again
12/22/22, 11:32 - Ottavio Italia: Nobody does really, just Roberta 🥲
12/22/22, 11:33 - Andrea Pavelkova: Giving us that real life example of how no one answers emails when u need it

12/22/22, 11:35 - Gabriel Rennó: I dont think she was THAT good. I think she is good when compared to the other ones
12/22/22, 11:35 - Gabriel Rennó: But in general
12/22/22, 11:35 - Gabriel Rennó: Nothing special
12/22/22, 11:35 - david: X2

12/23/22, 11:44 - Onassis Nottage: Such a Professional
12/23/22, 12:12 - Gabriel Rennó: Pissed by what?
12/23/22, 12:13 - Onassis Nottage: This is the second time in all four classes he graded attendance
12/23/22, 12:14 - Onassis Nottage: But the grades only include two classes so there’s a 50% for those who didn’t show up
12/23/22, 12:14 - Onassis Nottage: When it should be 75% for those who only didn’t show up to one class
12/24/22, 06:28 - david: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjiWSihpij-/?igshid=Yzg5MTU1MDY=

12/28/22, 22:20 - Onassis Nottage: And on the day I decided to do the homework, I can’t even do it

12/29/22, 11:56 - Ottavio Italia: Why

12/30/22, 18:17 - +51 991 496 946: Oh, you need to have jdk or jre installed before run talend
12/30/22, 18:17 - +51 991 496 946: And make sure to have JAVA_HOME as environment variable
12/30/22, 18:39 - Ottavio Italia: Yeah I managed thanks

1/5/23, 16:49 - Onassis Nottage: My plan was to take screenshots and write
1/5/23, 16:49 - Ottavio Italia: It just says we must upload a "file"
1/5/23, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: Okay, no I never tried to export anything
1/5/23, 16:50 - Onassis Nottage: I can try though
1/5/23, 16:52 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Onassis, Not to take into account assigmnemt, did you find Talend useful? I am not going to submit that assignment, unless you change my mind 😂😂
1/5/23, 16:53 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/5/23, 16:55 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Thank you !
1/5/23, 17:05 - Ottavio Italia: Im guessing we arent going to submit much
1/5/23, 17:06 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah I thought this was some revolutionary thingamajig lol
1/5/23, 17:06 - Onassis Nottage: And it could be useful in bigger companies
1/5/23, 19:32 - david: So who is not gonna present assignment 4?
1/5/23, 19:32 - Onassis Nottage: I'm doing it, just based on this entire thing, you just have to answer a few questions
1/5/23, 19:33 - Onassis Nottage: You have to assess the completeness, integrity, accuracy, uniqueness, and validity in two databases
1/5/23, 19:33 - Onassis Nottage: That won't take long, what took really long was just connecting to them
1/5/23, 19:33 - david: But the one with myphp
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: Did you run the SQL successfully?
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: I got errors
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: I was doing it manually
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: Remember yesterday when I was cursing a lot?
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah, that wasn't just for kicks lol
1/5/23, 19:34 - david: But it's a lot
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: There's an option at the bottom
1/5/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: I thought it was because I used a macbook
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: But before you run the query, uncheck that button
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: That was the problem I had, but when I unchecked it, it worked
1/5/23, 19:35 - Onassis Nottage: If anyone else had this same problem^
1/5/23, 19:38 - david: Still have an error "close to business"
1/5/23, 19:38 - david: 🫠
1/5/23, 19:41 - Onassis Nottage: Hmm
1/5/23, 19:41 - Onassis Nottage: Not sure what that means
1/5/23, 20:18 - david: I think it worked
1/5/23, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: I just sent mine in if anyone wants to build on theirs from it
1/5/23, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: Validity I just gave 100%
1/5/23, 21:33 - Onassis Nottage: That was the only one I didnt think about
1/6/23, 12:54 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: <Media omitted>
1/6/23, 12:55 - Ottavio Italia: I’m shocked
1/6/23, 13:10 - david: Ankit is the center
1/6/23, 13:26 - Onassis Nottage: Right 🤣🤣
1/6/23, 13:27 - Onassis Nottage: Id switch statistics with calculus and then calculus with linear algebra
1/6/23, 13:30 - Onassis Nottage: LinkedIn says otherwise lol
1/6/23, 13:30 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/6/23, 13:47 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Just kidding, it will be useful somewhere... :D

1/7/23, 13:43 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: https://amp.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jan/05/microsoft-chatgpt-bing-search-engine
1/7/23, 13:43 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Maybe we will be able to see good competitor of Google ! 🤟

1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: Hey everyone
1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: Daria moved classes to Friday
1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: In case you missed it
1/8/23, 13:05 - Onassis Nottage: And the Agile assignment is graded
1/8/23, 13:53 - Joseph México: Fuck it
1/8/23, 13:54 - Onassis Nottage: What happened?
1/8/23, 13:57 - Joseph México: 1 i came back from holidays earlier to go tomorrow to class,  2 i have a train this Thursday night to go out the weekend... both cost money,  time and missing an important class
1/8/23, 13:58 - Onassis Nottage: You can just go online
1/8/23, 13:58 - Onassis Nottage: I’m still in The Bahamas lol
1/8/23, 13:58 - Onassis Nottage: Flying back on Thursday
1/8/23, 13:59 - Onassis Nottage: But also, now that you mention it
1/8/23, 13:59 - Onassis Nottage: There needs to be an agreement
1/8/23, 14:00 - Onassis Nottage: If a lecturer misses class, and the class is moved to a day where we’re not supposed to have it in the first place, there shouldn’t be any graded homework, quizzes or classroom assignments and that entire class is considered optional to attend
1/8/23, 14:01 - Onassis Nottage: Because if we missed classes during the times scheduled, there are repercussions for us
1/8/23, 14:01 - Nils Jenninssen: Good thought!
1/8/23, 14:03 - Onassis Nottage: This is the ideal solution, I’m not sure they’d agree to this though lol
1/8/23, 14:03 - Joseph México: And i would say not on the same week,  as we have plans, meetings, other things
1/8/23, 14:04 - Joseph México: They have to give us some time to plan ahead,  that what a calendar is made for
1/8/23, 14:04 - Onassis Nottage: Professionals with a capital P
1/8/23, 14:20 - Gabriel Rennó: Yeah i will also be out of barcelona on friday

1/8/23, 14:21 - Gabriel Rennó: Yeah i know i just mean that it suck that they do this changes out of the blue
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: Come to think of it, we’re all out of Barcelona on Friday right?
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: Because i planned a trip on thirsday in order to not miss class
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: Anyways
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: I might just be on zoom
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: Oh wait
1/8/23, 14:22 - Gabriel Rennó: Not big deal after all
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: I’m actually not going to be in class for real
1/8/23, 14:22 - Onassis Nottage: I’m leaving Thursday, but I wont land until 10am Friday
1/8/23, 14:24 - Joseph México: If everyone is okay,  I'd ask to move it to the next available Friday

1/8/23, 17:51 - Onassis Nottage: We can, but I just gave it an extra month for everyone to get ready
1/8/23, 17:52 - david: Because the winter and the snow doesn't last until March I guess

1/8/23, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: I spoke with some of the other students
1/8/23, 22:06 - Onassis Nottage: I think we can plan our own trip to California
1/8/23, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: That’s way too much money to visit “companies like” Google
1/8/23, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: The housing and plane aren’t included in the price
1/8/23, 22:07 - Andrea Pavelkova: Rip
1/8/23, 22:07 - Onassis Nottage: I don’t mind doing it if thats what everyone wants, but I’m sure we can plan something ourselves
1/8/23, 22:08 - Onassis Nottage: $5k for each person would get us a really nice place, plane ticket, and things to do over there
1/10/23, 12:01 - Onassis Nottage: 🫠

1/10/23, 12:08 - Onassis Nottage: I have to study a lot after this
1/10/23, 12:09 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: Too technical? Let's see 😅 big data/engineering part is really difficult
1/10/23, 12:10 - Onassis Nottage: Yeah it’s technical, but I just think its a lot to grap in such a short time
1/10/23, 12:11 - Onassis Nottage: Just have to do some research on the physical systems and play with AWS after this ends

1/17/23, 15:02 - Joseph México: gracias
1/17/23, 17:34 - Onassis Nottage: Guess who also got blocked on idealista :)
1/17/23, 17:37 - david: Try with Scrapy
1/17/23, 17:38 - Onassis Nottage: OrI could just turn it in and hope it works
1/17/23, 17:46 - david: Can you send me the last piece of code we saw for extracting the details?
1/17/23, 17:46 - david: The 2 lines of code that he showed us
1/17/23, 18:01 - Onassis Nottage: I have no idea lol
1/17/23, 18:03 - david: <Media omitted>
1/17/23, 19:08 - Onassis Nottage: I don't have that
1/17/23, 19:08 - Onassis Nottage: I think I got rid of it
1/17/23, 19:19 - Gabriel Rennó: He was supposed to upload on canvas
1/17/23, 19:31 - david: He didn't upload the recorded lecture
1/17/23, 19:31 - david: Neither
1/17/23, 19:33 - Onassis Nottage: Sigh
1/17/23, 19:34 - Onassis Nottage: He's gonna get whatever I give him
1/17/23, 19:35 - david: And then you get a 100
1/17/23, 19:36 - Onassis Nottage: I'd love to see that lol

1/17/23, 19:40 - Onassis Nottage: I had to pull 500 accounts to get 90 of them that had the size
1/17/23, 19:43 - david: Good to know
1/17/23, 20:25 - Ottavio Italia: Yep, got banned
1/17/23, 20:38 - Onassis Nottage: I did a Hail Mary

1/17/23, 20:42 - Onassis Nottage: It's super abstract
1/17/23, 20:43 - Onassis Nottage: I still scraped the site without knowing if anything works lol
1/17/23, 20:44 - Onassis Nottage: But I'm turning it in
1/17/23, 20:44 - Ottavio Italia: So you didnt compare london and barcelona
1/17/23, 20:45 - Ottavio Italia: But the sites?
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: What do you mean?
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: Aren't we supposed to compare it?
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: Rightmove is London
1/17/23, 20:45 - Onassis Nottage: And Idealista is Barcelona
1/17/23, 20:46 - Onassis Nottage: Did I get confused?
1/17/23, 20:46 - Onassis Nottage: 👀
1/17/23, 20:47 - Ottavio Italia: yeah but you said that rightmove has a higer squared meter price than idealista
1/17/23, 20:47 - Onassis Nottage: No
1/17/23, 20:47 - Ottavio Italia: While the difference is the city thats all
1/17/23, 20:47 - Onassis Nottage: That's just me testing the data
1/17/23, 20:47 - Ottavio Italia: Then im confused
1/17/23, 20:48 - Onassis Nottage: The abstract says that "whatever is the highest" has a higher squared meter price than "whatever has the lowest"
1/17/23, 20:48 - Onassis Nottage: Or should I have said London and Barcelona, instead of Rightmove and Idealista?
1/17/23, 20:49 - Onassis Nottage: <Media omitted>
1/17/23, 20:49 - Joseph México: I'm still blocked from idealista
1/17/23, 20:49 - Onassis Nottage: Me too
1/17/23, 20:49 - Ottavio Italia: So you managed to scrape idealista?
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: Not at all lmaoo
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: I'm still continuing as if I had
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: And turning that in
1/17/23, 20:50 - Ottavio Italia: Oh you're just using test data, sorry im tired
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: I'm not using any data
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: Just writing code
1/17/23, 20:50 - Onassis Nottage: No idea if this will work
1/17/23, 20:50 - Ottavio Italia: Ok i will now stop asking questions
1/17/23, 20:51 - Onassis Nottage: But I won't have time to think about that, since I'm traveling
1/17/23, 20:51 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaoooo

1/17/23, 22:20 - Ottavio Italia: @12428076373 I lost my notebook too for some reason, can you post the code for th elondon stuff where you need to specify dd and dt classes?
1/17/23, 22:41 - Onassis Nottage: I dont have that

1/17/23, 22:42 - Onassis Nottage: I replaced it with the one Miguel updated
1/17/23, 22:47 - Ottavio Italia: And how did you gett the london dataframe?
1/17/23, 22:48 - Ottavio Italia: Oh it doesnt have that info
1/17/23, 22:52 - Onassis Nottage: He has the link to the homework

1/18/23, 18:27 - Ottavio Italia: Unluckily no, a few of us also needs it :(
1/18/23, 18:32 - Gabriel Rennó: I dont have it but i managed the code to extract the info from the london website
1/18/23, 18:32 - Gabriel Rennó: Is that what you need or sth else?
1/18/23, 18:34 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I was just revising staff, I was little uncomfortable about scraping. I have not started yet, thanks, will let you know if something 🤟
1/18/23, 18:41 - Gabriel Rennó: @12428076373 and @393663863107 how didi you scrappe ideaist after getting blocked?
1/18/23, 18:44 - david: Yes pls
1/18/23, 18:45 - david: Onassis didn't, he just used the London info as it was from Idealista
1/19/23, 11:05 - Onassis Nottage: @4915750950176 can you resend the API and link?
1/19/23, 11:16 - Onassis Nottage: Got it
1/19/23, 11:59 - david: At the end he is gonna delete the whole code so he won't have an error
1/19/23, 12:00 - Ottavio Italia: Ahahahahah
1/19/23, 12:01 - Onassis Nottage: That took a minute
1/19/23, 12:11 - Joseph México: does he even know?
1/19/23, 12:12 - Afolabi: 🤣🤣🤣
1/19/23, 12:12 - david: He told us to code so we can learn but he doesn't even know how to fix an error

1/19/23, 12:15 - Ottavio Italia: They sure did
1/19/23, 12:15 - david: I didn't
1/19/23, 12:16 - Ottavio Italia: Guys if we trained the data that would be the trained data
1/19/23, 12:16 - Ottavio Italia: Ok ill stop
1/19/23, 12:19 - david: That's why I gave him a 1 in the last poll
1/19/23, 12:20 - Joseph México: q: how to fix an error in python?
a: delete the line
1/19/23, 12:21 - david: He's clicking stop to delete the results
1/19/23, 12:21 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm so confused
1/19/23, 12:21 - david: He's more than you
1/19/23, 12:23 - david: He just did it again
1/19/23, 12:23 - Joseph México: if you have multiple errors, just do a for loop
1/19/23, 12:24 - Joseph México: for error in jupyter:
     q: how to fix an error in python?
     a: delete the line

1/19/23, 12:29 - Gabriel Rennó: he didnt. I asked him but he gave a trash explanation
1/19/23, 12:30 - david: He said because you need it to train
1/19/23, 12:30 - Onassis Nottage: Y’all are hilarious
1/19/23, 12:31 - david: He should take some machine learning classes
1/19/23, 12:31 - david: On kaggle
1/19/23, 12:31 - Andrea Pavelkova: So what he meant by "I need your participation" was actually "I need you to fix my code for me"
1/19/23, 12:31 - david: That makes a lot of sense
1/19/23, 12:32 - Joseph México: "I need you to learn along side me"
1/19/23, 12:35 - Onassis Nottage: pip install Andrea
1/19/23, 12:37 - Andrea Pavelkova: If I was an AI I would be so happy...
1/19/23, 12:38 - Onassis Nottage: 😂😂😂😂
1/19/23, 12:39 - david: Until now
1/19/23, 12:40 - Andrea Pavelkova: We should run a model to predict how the next classes go

1/19/23, 12:52 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm sitting here like ???????
1/19/23, 12:52 - david: Thanks for nothing
1/19/23, 12:53 - Andrea Pavelkova: I wanted him to feel like I spoke at least once
1/19/23, 13:30 - Onassis Nottage: He was calling you and some others earlier in the class but no one answered

1/19/23, 22:37 - Ruben Tak: 👌

1/20/23, 10:04 - Onassis Nottage: It works!
1/20/23, 10:04 - Andrea Pavelkova: Much better, thanks!
1/20/23, 10:16 - Gabriel Rennó: Am i the only one who feel thats slightly wrong?
1/20/23, 10:16 - Ottavio Italia: Apparently not

1/20/23, 10:17 - Joseph México: we are here to learn, everyone, including the teacher
1/20/23, 10:18 - Ottavio Italia: I am at a point where i dont think it is fun anymore

1/20/23, 10:39 - Joseph México: Send him the clip
1/20/23, 11:31 - Andrea Pavelkova: Did he just.... ask me a question and then answer himself
1/20/23, 11:31 - Andrea Pavelkova: I'm so confused by this guy
1/20/23, 11:32 - Gabriel Rennó: And he gave the wrong answer
1/20/23, 11:32 - Onassis Nottage: He’s trying to see who’s online
1/20/23, 11:39 - Ottavio Italia: He doesn’t know
1/20/23, 11:40 - Onassis Nottage: I noticed 😪
1/20/23, 11:40 - Joseph México: haha

1/20/23, 11:52 - Ottavio Italia: Yes I am paying do that this guy copies code and then expects us to go find out for ourselves
1/20/23, 11:52 - Ottavio Italia: So*
1/20/23, 11:54 - Onassis Nottage: Lmaoooooo
1/20/23, 11:57 - david: Started to snow today in Amsterdam
