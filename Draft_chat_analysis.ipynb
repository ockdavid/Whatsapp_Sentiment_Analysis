      "11/7/22, 17:25 - Ruben Tak: But we as the students are the customers at the end of the day, we should try to make our time here of the highest quality as possible, despite the emotions that might get involved\n",

      "11/7/22, 17:27 - david: Talk with both at the same time is better so Anki will notice that we're really worry about this\n",
      "11/7/22, 17:28 - Mamuka Barnabishvili: I know that it will be the same, but I agree with Ruben, we should speak with him as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "*Delegate meetings* - This space is to allow inclusive and human centered approach to share ideas. All meetings will not be recorded, in hopes to feel as a safe space to share any concern. These meetings are to share issues with BTS as a whole, if we need to meet as MBDS, we can ask for a meeting with Sergio and Daria offline.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Coffee Machine* - They're currently in the process of trying to get an actual vending machine instead of a coffee machine\n",
      "\n",
      "*Christmas event* - December 16th there will be a wine festival, it's a Christmas event, and we have sommeliers giving us different wine to taste during the experience\n",
      "\n",
      "*Budgets and allocations* - If we have a collective idea for an event or product, just let me know and we can discuss as delegates to see if we can get backing from as many persons in BTS to get what we need. There is currently not a budget number related, but we can ask for an event with a description in advance, we can recommend an event for all of us in BTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Global Chapters Program* - This is more of an immersion trip as opposed of internships, Daria will discuss to coordinate the trip and it can involve other students in the masters. I've also asked to see if we can raise money for some of the students who would like to go but don't have the funds to do it now.  \n",
      "\n",
      "*UB Digital Badge* - We will have access to a few of the resources on the UB campus including access to the library by the end of this week. They have the information, but it's in Catalan so they're currently translating the documents to English for us. In the meantime they there are other library spaces they will send and coworking spaces they will list for us in the meantime (it's easy to apply for a library card).\n",
      "\n",
      "*Wifi Hack* - BTS has different routers, if you're having bad connectivity, you can disconnect and reconnect to the nearest router in BTS\n",
      "\n",
      "*Universal Microphone* - This term they should have a universal microphone (they're working to resolve the issues as soon as possible). The classroom noise we hear is only happening in our room, the other rooms don't have this issue, and it's only happening for persons who are remotely (not for persons who are online in the classroom).\n",
      "\n",
      "*Lost and Found* - Any items in the lost and found can be checked by the reception, so if you ever lose anything, you can check there for them\n",

These meetings are to share issues with BTS as a whole, if we need to meet as MBDS, we can ask for a meeting with Sergio and Daria offline.\n",

      "*Coffee Machine* - They're currently in the process of trying to get an actual vending machine instead of a coffee machine\n",

      "\n",
      "*Budgets and allocations* - If we have a collective idea for an event or product, just let me know and we can discuss as delegates to see if we can get backing from as many persons in BTS to get what we need. There is currently not a budget number related, but we can ask for an event with a description in advance, we can recommend an event for all of us in BTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Global Chapters Program* - This is more of an immersion trip as opposed of internships, Daria will discuss to coordinate the trip and it can involve other students in the masters. I've also asked to see if we can raise money for some of the students who would like to go but don't have the funds to do it now.  \n",

      "*UB Digital Badge* - We will have access to a few of the resources on the UB campus including access to the library by the end of this week. They have the information, but it's in Catalan so they're currently translating the documents to English for us. In the meantime they there are other library spaces they will send and coworking spaces they will list for us in the meantime (it's easy to apply for a library card).\n",

      "*Wifi Hack* - BTS has different routers, if you're having bad connectivity, you can disconnect and reconnect to the nearest router in BTS\n",
      "\n",
      "*Universal Microphone* - This term they should have a universal microphone (they're working to resolve the issues as soon as possible). The classroom noise we hear is only happening in our room, the other rooms don't have this issue, and it's only happening for persons who are remotely (not for persons who are online in the classroom).\n",

Ottavio Italia Im trying to run it in the terminal but the point i cant get across is the logic of the code itself    david You can write your code on a notepad and save it with the py like filepy and it is a py file    david And what you write there is the same as a notebook    david I can explain you after the My digital impact    Gabriel Rennó  Media omitted     Gabriel Rennó mine looks like this    Ottavio Italia  Media omitted     david I can't hear now    Onassis Nottage In Ikigai can't hear this    Ottavio Italia Its ok dont worry just me rambling anyway    Ottavio Italia Mine is basically identical    Joseph México  Media omitted     Joseph México do you know if this is okay?

Lol    Joseph México do you know if Ankit is teaching any other courses?    Onassis Nottage So far    Onassis Nottage Big data something    Joseph México fuck    Onassis Nottage Or advanced data science?    Onassis Nottage One of the two    Joseph México can we request a another teacher?    Ruben Tak @ class representative    Joseph México I mean I guess we can but Idk if I am the only one that would want that    Ottavio Italia Harsh but I agree    Onassis Nottage If the majority wants a new one I’ll march in the streets till we do    Ottavio Italia 🎉    Ottavio Italia I think he’s super nice I just don’t think we learned much yet and his method seems a bit off to me    Joseph México i would talk with Daria to see what are the options i am not happy with the class itself and even less with so many remotemissing clases    Joseph México i mean he is nice I like him he would be my friend but idk if my teacher    Onassis Nottage I agree    Gabriel Rennó maybe we can suggest them to hire a teacher who actually teaches    Ottavio Italia Savage    Onassis Nottage Lol    Joseph México agree    Onassis Nottage I just don’t see much of a correlation between what he teaches and what we should know be prepared for in the real world    Onassis Nottage I studied math myself and no job is going to ask me to find a hypergeometric distribution    Onassis Nottage At least not the ones I worked for    Ottavio Italia Was about to say you have a degree in mathematics    Onassis Nottage No case studies or anything    Ottavio Italia Which I think strengthens the statement    david Same here    Onassis Nottage I get what he’s trying to do but there’s no way to accomplish that in this short timeframe with this diverse group    Onassis Nottage The best solution is case studies to see where to apply different things    david He's just following the idea of the course statistics    Gabriel Rennó I mean i feel like i didnt learn *anything* from this class    Ruben Tak A man of the people 🤝    Ottavio Italia He said “try and apply these concepts to databases you find” Yeah ok    Gabriel Rennó And we are paying for that    Onassis Nottage Lmaooooo    Gabriel Rennó So it kind of sucks    Onassis Nottage We can do this if you want?    Onassis Nottage I can find something on Kaggle    david Because we don't learn like Hindus do    Onassis Nottage But I just figured no one would’ve cared about that extra assignment    Ottavio Italia Honestly it doesn’t help if I’m randomly plotting correlation heatmaps    Ottavio Italia What we are doing with DSF is at least pointing towards a case study    Onassis Nottage Yeah I actually liked the last class though when he took us through the court system data and hypothesis testing    Joseph México i think there is not much we can do for this course (hopefully there is) but what I suggest is to talk to Daria to prevent this for future courses eg Big Data whatever advanced balh blah    Joseph México if the majority agrees    Onassis Nottage Yeah I really don’t want this to be theoretical if that’s the only big data class we’ll have for the program    Gabriel Rennó agree    david Ankit is gonna teach us (hopefully not) big data infrastructure    david That scares me because at least I know a little bit of statistics    david But Big Data Infrastructure sounds like the core of this master    Onassis Nottage Yeah we’d be half dead in there and that’s the major portion lol    Joseph México I have created this form so we can vote on this 🙂 httpsformsglebhVpTrURsKFprJa It´s asking for emails just so we dont have duplicated answers    Joseph México Please fill there is also a i dont mind option if you dont care    david Done    Amos Done    Ruben Tak I voted for a new one but I was wondering if we shouldn’t inform him about the problem first as well as we now in a way will go over his head without informing him how we feel Chances are ofcourse then that he will make promises to improve and there will not be looked for a new teacher    Ruben Tak Just to speak my mind    Ottavio Italia Actually I agree with this he seems very willing to do better perhaps we owe him that    Joseph México I think we already did a couple of times but we can do it once more    Joseph México i think we have done it a couple of times maybe we havent been clear neither on what we wantexpect    Joseph México but sure let´s speak our mind to him    Ruben Tak But we as the students are the customers at the end of the day we should try to make our time here of the highest quality as possible despite the emotions that might get involved    david He is kind of trying that's why the last class was better    Ruben Tak Let’s do it with daria as well in the conversation to make this process as short as possible    Mamuka Barnabishvili So maybe tomorrows lecture can be last chance? I mean He is doing remote  he knows He needs to do good job to keep us motivated more than in the class  if the studying style would be different I think we should talk to Daria and be very clear    Ruben Tak Yeah but let’s inform him about it now so he has some time to change some last things if he feels like he needs to    Joseph México you mean by email?    david Talk with both at the same time is better so Anki will notice that we're really worry about this    Mamuka Barnabishvili I know that it will be the same but I agree with Ruben we should speak with him as well    david @ 💪🏼    Mamuka Barnabishvili So how do you think would be better to describe our pain? 😅    Ruben Tak I think? 😅    Ruben Tak I think we should make a customer journey map    Joseph México agree    david Let's plot the results with Tableau    Mamuka Barnabishvili Guys find something for skills maping    Gabriel Rennó I agree that we as customers from bts have all the right to be upset with the service    Gabriel Rennó So we should let daria or whoever know it asap    Joseph México I´d say talk with him tomorrow and with Daria in parallel just saying what we feel as for now % ( votes) want a new teacher so it´s not a small concern    Joseph México let´s speak to both so either he can improve but at the same time for BTS to start thinking about possible solutions before we are down the wire    Mamuka Barnabishvili *    david Probably I'm going to the school tomorrow so I can call Daria to join us    david  Media omitted     david The Big Data crew    Ruben Tak Amos looks like the new Drake 😂    Onassis Nottage  Media omitted     Onassis Nottage No classes today…    Joseph México Why im not surprise    Joseph México  Media omitted     david 🤦🏻‍♂️    Ottavio Italia Ah    Ottavio Italia I was panicking since zoom wasn’t working    Ottavio Italia Guys do we get a discount for the smart city expo?

Ottavio Italia Im trying to run it in the terminal but the point i cant get across is the logic of the code itself    david You can write your code on a notepad and save it with the py like filepy and it is a py file    david And what you write there is the same as a notebook    david I can explain you after the My digital impact    Gabriel Rennó  Media omitted     Gabriel Rennó mine looks like this    Ottavio Italia  Media omitted     david I can't hear now    Onassis Nottage In Ikigai can't hear this    Ottavio Italia Its ok dont worry just me rambling anyway    Ottavio Italia Mine is basically identical    Joseph México  Media omitted     Joseph México do you know if this is okay?

Lol    Joseph México do you know if Ankit is teaching any other courses?    Onassis Nottage So far    Onassis Nottage Big data something    Joseph México fuck    Onassis Nottage Or advanced data science?    Onassis Nottage One of the two    Joseph México can we request a another teacher?    Ruben Tak @ class representative    Joseph México I mean I guess we can but Idk if I am the only one that would want that    Ottavio Italia Harsh but I agree    Onassis Nottage If the majority wants a new one I’ll march in the streets till we do    Ottavio Italia 🎉    Ottavio Italia I think he’s super nice I just don’t think we learned much yet and his method seems a bit off to me    Joseph México i would talk with Daria to see what are the options i am not happy with the class itself and even less with so many remotemissing clases    Joseph México i mean he is nice I like him he would be my friend but idk if my teacher    Onassis Nottage I agree    Gabriel Rennó maybe we can suggest them to hire a teacher who actually teaches    Ottavio Italia Savage    Onassis Nottage Lol    Joseph México agree    Onassis Nottage I just don’t see much of a correlation between what he teaches and what we should know be prepared for in the real world    Onassis Nottage I studied math myself and no job is going to ask me to find a hypergeometric distribution    Onassis Nottage At least not the ones I worked for    Ottavio Italia Was about to say you have a degree in mathematics    Onassis Nottage No case studies or anything    Ottavio Italia Which I think strengthens the statement    david Same here    Onassis Nottage I get what he’s trying to do but there’s no way to accomplish that in this short timeframe with this diverse group    Onassis Nottage The best solution is case studies to see where to apply different things    david He's just following the idea of the course statistics    Gabriel Rennó I mean i feel like i didnt learn *anything* from this class    Ruben Tak A man of the people 🤝    Ottavio Italia He said “try and apply these concepts to databases you find” Yeah ok    Gabriel Rennó And we are paying for that    Onassis Nottage Lmaooooo    Gabriel Rennó So it kind of sucks    Onassis Nottage We can do this if you want?    Onassis Nottage I can find something on Kaggle    david Because we don't learn like Hindus do    Onassis Nottage But I just figured no one would’ve cared about that extra assignment    Ottavio Italia Honestly it doesn’t help if I’m randomly plotting correlation heatmaps    Ottavio Italia What we are doing with DSF is at least pointing towards a case study    Onassis Nottage Yeah I actually liked the last class though when he took us through the court system data and hypothesis testing    Joseph México i think there is not much we can do for this course (hopefully there is) but what I suggest is to talk to Daria to prevent this for future courses eg Big Data whatever advanced balh blah    Joseph México if the majority agrees    Onassis Nottage Yeah I really don’t want this to be theoretical if that’s the only big data class we’ll have for the program    Gabriel Rennó agree    david Ankit is gonna teach us (hopefully not) big data infrastructure    david That scares me because at least I know a little bit of statistics    david But Big Data Infrastructure sounds like the core of this master    Onassis Nottage Yeah we’d be half dead in there and that’s the major portion lol    Joseph México I have created this form so we can vote on this 🙂 httpsformsglebhVpTrURsKFprJa It´s asking for emails just so we dont have duplicated answers    Joseph México Please fill there is also a i dont mind option if you dont care    david Done    Amos Done    Ruben Tak I voted for a new one but I was wondering if we shouldn’t inform him about the problem first as well as we now in a way will go over his head without informing him how we feel Chances are ofcourse then that he will make promises to improve and there will not be looked for a new teacher    Ruben Tak Just to speak my mind    Ottavio Italia Actually I agree with this he seems very willing to do better perhaps we owe him that    Joseph México I think we already did a couple of times but we can do it once more    Joseph México i think we have done it a couple of times maybe we havent been clear neither on what we wantexpect    Joseph México but sure let´s speak our mind to him    Ruben Tak But we as the students are the customers at the end of the day we should try to make our time here of the highest quality as possible despite the emotions that might get involved    david He is kind of trying that's why the last class was better    Ruben Tak Let’s do it with daria as well in the conversation to make this process as short as possible    Mamuka Barnabishvili So maybe tomorrows lecture can be last chance? I mean He is doing remote  he knows He needs to do good job to keep us motivated more than in the class  if the studying style would be different I think we should talk to Daria and be very clear    Ruben Tak Yeah but let’s inform him about it now so he has some time to change some last things if he feels like he needs to    Joseph México you mean by email?    david Talk with both at the same time is better so Anki will notice that we're really worry about this    Mamuka Barnabishvili I know that it will be the same but I agree with Ruben we should speak with him as well    david @ 💪🏼    Mamuka Barnabishvili So how do you think would be better to describe our pain? 😅    Ruben Tak I think? 😅    Ruben Tak I think we should make a customer journey map    Joseph México agree    david Let's plot the results with Tableau    Mamuka Barnabishvili Guys find something for skills maping    Gabriel Rennó I agree that we as customers from bts have all the right to be upset with the service    Gabriel Rennó So we should let daria or whoever know it asap    Joseph México I´d say talk with him tomorrow and with Daria in parallel just saying what we feel as for now % ( votes) want a new teacher so it´s not a small concern    Joseph México let´s speak to both so either he can improve but at the same time for BTS to start thinking about possible solutions before we are down the wire    Mamuka Barnabishvili *    david Probably I'm going to the school tomorrow so I can call Daria to join us    david  Media omitted     david The Big Data crew    Ruben Tak Amos looks like the new Drake 😂    Onassis Nottage  Media omitted     Onassis Nottage No classes today…    Joseph México Why im not surprise    Joseph México  Media omitted     david 🤦🏻\\u200d♂️    Ottavio Italia Ah    Ottavio Italia I was panicking since zoom wasn’t working    Ottavio Italia Guys do we get a discount for the smart city expo?

Gabriel, Rennó, I, just, pointed, out, to, him, with, comments, in, the, code, Ottavio, Italia, Same, Ottavio, Italia, It, took, me, a, total, of, hours, to, do, the, assignment, Ottavio, Italia, Ruben, Tak, Ruben, Tak, I, in, Spain, but, the, s, is, silent, Onassis, Nottage, Kml, Onassis, Nottage, Lmao, Ottavio, Italia, Media, omitted, Ruben, Tak, Media, omitted, Gabriel, Rennó, Media, omitted, Onassis, Nottage, Lmao, Ottavio, Italia, Ahahahahhaha, david, is, the, mean, alcohol, consumption, per, continent, for, every, column, entry, This, is, asking, for, Or, the, mean, of, all, the, columns, Onassis, Nottage, I, used, the, total, litres, column, david, I, think, that, column, is, the, result, of, the, columns, that, are, next, to, it, right, Ottavio, Italia, I, do, know, he, asks, for, every, column, entry, Ottavio, Italia, I, outputted, all, columns, Ottavio, Italia, To, me, it, seemed, he, asked, for, all, of, em, david, Yea, that, confuses, me, Onassis, Nottage, How, much, points, is, this, david, Ottavio, Italia, In, a, way, yes, but, since, it, not, a, direct, sum, I, would, say, it, the, same, thing, to, only, use, that, Onassis, Nottage, david, I, write, both, answers, Onassis, Nottage, Let, me, take, a, look, at, this, Onassis, Nottage, Right, Onassis, Nottage, And, for, the, brave, ones, Onassis, Nottage, Is, that, a, bonus, david, Nope, Onassis, Nottage, Why, he, label, it, like, it, was, Ottavio, Italia, Because, you, actually, need, to, be, brave, Ottavio, Italia, At, least, I, had, to, Ottavio, Italia, Onassis, Nottage, I, really, did, want, to, look, back, a, the, other, questions, Onassis, Nottage, I, solved, it, david, Because, if, you, ca, do, it, you, should, feel, bad, because, you, are, not, a, brave, one, Onassis, Nottage, So, I, did, really, care, if, this, was, right, or, wrong, david, Media, omitted, Onassis, Nottage, I, aware, of, the, points, lol, but, are, the, points, optional, is, what, I, asking, Ottavio, Italia, Honestly, if, he, counts, it, as, wrong, I, say, that, it, was, very, clear, Onassis, Nottage, Yeah, I, not, interested, in, this, homework, anymore, Onassis, Nottage, I, looked, at, this, too, much, Ottavio, Italia, I, mean, it, wo, change, much, I, do, think, grades, matter, a, lot, but, still, david, The, sum, is, points, including, the, last, part, Onassis, Nottage, I, answered, everything, lol, I, just, do, believe, we, need, to, overthink, what, he, asking, Onassis, Nottage, The, instructions, should, been, more, clearer, Ottavio, Italia, I, agree, we, all, could, go, back, but, meh, Onassis, Nottage, Lol, I, appreciate, you, Onassis, Nottage, I, know, exactly, how, you, feel, about, this, david, Do, worry, it, only, david, Media, omitted, david, Onassis, Nottage, Did, this, change, david, Waaaait, Onassis, Nottage, He, kept, talking, about, it, in, class, Onassis, Nottage, I, ca, remember, what, each, one, is, now, though, david, Media, omitted, Onassis, Nottage, There, we, go, Onassis, Nottage, That, it, david, I, think, that, the, right, one, david, Onassis, Nottage, Lmaoo, Onassis, Nottage, C, get, degrees, Onassis, Nottage, Ohhhh, Onassis, Nottage, Wait, Onassis, Nottage, if, it, out, of, Onassis, Nottage, We, could, still, not, give, a, shit, about, that, question, Onassis, Nottage, Because, it, if, everything, else, is, right, Onassis, Nottage, Including, total, liters, of, pure, alcohol, Ottavio, Italia, Yep, Ottavio, Italia, Yes, i, just, do, nt, think, its, smart, to, give, confusing, instruction, to, people, that, have, to, face, problems, they,

I, am, the, only, one, that, would, want, that, Ottavio, Italia, Harsh, but, I, agree, Onassis, Nottage, If, the, majority, wants, a, new, one, I, march, in, the, streets, till, we, do, Ottavio, Italia, Ottavio, Italia, I, think, he, super, nice, I, just, do, think, we, learned, much, yet, and, his, method, seems, a, bit, off, to, me, Joseph, México, i, would, talk, with, Daria, to, see, what, are, the, options, i, am, not, happy, with, the, class, itself, and, even, less, with, so, many, remote, missing, clases, Joseph, México, i, mean, he, is, nice, I, like, him, he, would, be, my, friend, but, idk, if, my, teacher, Onassis, Nottage, I, agree, Gabriel, Rennó, maybe, we, can, suggest, them, to, hire, a, teacher, who, actually, teaches, Ottavio, Italia, Savage, Onassis, Nottage, Lol, Joseph, México, agree, Onassis, Nottage, I, just, do, see, much, of, a, correlation, between, what, he, teaches, and, what, we, should, be, prepared, for, in, the, real, world, Onassis, Nottage, I, studied, math, myself, and, no, job, is, going, to, ask, me, to, find, a, hypergeometric, distribution, Onassis, Nottage, At, least, not, the, ones, I, worked, for, Ottavio, Italia, Was, about, to, say, you, have, a, degree, in, mathematics, Onassis, Nottage, No, case, studies, or, anything, Ottavio, Italia, Which, I, think, strengthens, the, statement, david, Same, here, Onassis, Nottage, I, get, what, he, trying, to, do, but, there, no, way, to, accomplish, that, in, this, short, timeframe, with, this, diverse, group, Onassis, Nottage, The, best, solution, is, case, studies, to, see, where, to, apply, different, things, david, He, just, following, the, idea, of, the, course, statistics, Gabriel, Rennó, I, mean, i, feel, like, i, did, nt, learn, anything, from, this, class, Ruben, Tak, A, man, of, the, people, Ottavio, Italia, He, said, try, and, apply, these, concepts, to, databases, you, find, Yeah, ok, Gabriel, Rennó, And, we, are, paying, for, that, Onassis, Nottage, Lmaooooo, Gabriel, Rennó, So, it, kind, of, sucks, Onassis, Nottage, We, can, do, this, if, you, want, Onassis, Nottage, I, can, find, something, on, Kaggle, david, Because, we, do, learn, like, Hindus, do, Onassis, Nottage, But, I, just, figured, no, one, would, cared, about, that, extra, assignment, Ottavio, Italia, Honestly, it, does, help, if, I, randomly, plotting, correlation, heatmaps, Ottavio, Italia, What, we, are, doing, with, DSF, is, at, least, pointing, towards, a, case, study, Onassis, Nottage, Yeah, I, actually, liked, the, last, class, though, when, he, took, us, through, the, court, system, data, and, hypothesis, testing, Joseph, México, i, think, there, is, not, much, we, can, do, for, this, course, hopefully, there, is, but, what, I, suggest, is, to, talk, to, Daria, to, prevent, this, for, future, courses, Big, Data, whatever, advanced, balh, blah, Joseph, México, if, the, majority, agrees, Onassis, Nottage, Yeah, I, really, do, want, this, to, be, theoretical, if, that, the, only, big, data, class, we, have, for, the, program, Gabriel, Rennó, agree, david, Ankit, is, gon, na, teach, us, hopefully, not, big, data, infrastructure, david, That, scares, me, because, at, least, I, know, a, little, bit, of, statistics, david, But, Big, Data, Infrastructure, sounds, like, the, core, of, this, master, Onassis, Nottage, Yeah, we, be, half, dead, in, there, and, that, the, major, portion, lol, Joseph, México, I, have, created, this, form, so, we, can, vote, on, this, asking, for, emails, just, so, we, do, nt, have, duplicated, answers, Joseph, México, Please, fill, there, is, also, a, i, do, nt, mind, option, if, you, do, nt, care, david, Done, Amos, Done, Ruben, Tak, I, voted, for, a, new, one, but, I, was, wondering, if, we, should, inform, him, about, the, problem, first, as, well, as, we, now, in, a, way, will, go, over, his, head, without, informing, him, how, we, feel, Chances, are, ofcourse, then, that, he, will, make, promises, to, improve, and, there, will, not, be, looked, for, a, new, teacher, Ruben, Tak, Just, to, speak, my, mind, Ottavio, Italia, Actually, I, agree, with, this, he, seems, very, willing, to, do, better, perhaps, we, owe, him, that, Joseph, México, I, think, we, already, did, a, couple, of, times, but, we, can, do, it, once, more, Joseph, México, i, think, we, have, done, it, a, couple, of, times, maybe, we, have, nt, been, clear, neither, on, what, we, want, expect, Joseph, México, but, sure, speak, our, mind, to, him, Ruben, Tak, But, we, as, the, students, are, the, customers, at, the, end, of, the, day, we, should, try, to, make, our, time, here, of, the, highest, quality, as, possible, despite, the, emotions, that, might, get, involved, david, He, is, kind, of, trying, that, why, the, last, class, was, better, Ruben, Tak, Let, do, it, with, daria, as, well, in, the, conversation, to, make, this, process, as, short, as, possible, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, So, maybe, tomorrows, lecture, can, be, last, chance, I, mean, He, is, doing, remote, he, knows, He, needs, to, do, good, job, to, keep, us, motivated, more, than, in, the, class, if, the, studying, style, would, be, different, I, think, we, should, talk, to, Daria, and, be, very, clear, Ruben, Tak, Yeah, but, let, inform, him, about, it, now, so, he, has, some, time, to, change, some, last, things, if, he, feels, like, he, needs, to, Joseph, México, you, mean, by, email, david, Talk, with, both, at, the, same, time, is, better, so, Anki, will, notice, that, we, really, worry, about, this, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, I, know, that, it, will, be, the, same, but, I, agree, with, Ruben, we, should, speak, with, him, as, well, david, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, So, how, do, you, think, would, be, better, to, describe, our, pain, Ruben, Tak, I, think, Ruben, Tak, I, think, we, should, make, a, customer, journey, map, Joseph, México, agree, david, Let, plot, the, results, with, Tableau, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, Guys, find, something, for, skills, maping, Gabriel, Rennó, I, agree, that, we, as, customers, from, bts, have, all, the, right, to, be, upset, with, the, service, Gabriel, Rennó, So, we, should, let, daria, or, whoever, know, it, asap, Joseph, México, say, talk, with, him, tomorrow, and, with, Daria, in, parallel, just, saying, what, we, feel, as, for, now, votes, want, a, new, teacher, so, not, a, small, concern, Joseph, México, speak, to, both, so, either, he, can, improve, but, at, the, same, time, for, BTS, to, start, thinking, about, possible, solutions, before, we, are, down, the, wire, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, david, Probably, I, going, to, the, school, tomorrow, so, I, can, call, Daria, to, join, us, david, Media, omitted, david, The, Big, Data, crew, Ruben,

david, And, then, you, get, a, Onassis, Nottage, I, love, to, see, that, lol, Onassis, Nottage, Media, omitted, Onassis, Nottage, Media, omitted, Onassis, Nottage, I, had, to, pull, accounts, to, get, of, them, that, had, the, size, david, Good, to, know, Ottavio, Italia, Yep, got, banned, Onassis, Nottage, I, did, a, Hail, Mary, Onassis, Nottage, Media, omitted, Onassis, Nottage, It, super, abstract, Onassis, Nottage, I, still, scraped, the, site, without, knowing, if, anything, works, lol, Onassis, Nottage, But, I, turning, it, in, Ottavio, Italia, So, you, did, nt, compare, london, and, barcelona, Ottavio, Italia, But, the, sites, Onassis, Nottage, What, do, you, mean, Onassis, Nottage, Are, we, supposed, to, compare, it, Onassis, Nottage, Rightmove, is, London, Onassis, Nottage, And, Idealista, is, Barcelona, Onassis, Nottage, Did, I, get, confused, Onassis, Nottage, Ottavio, Italia, yeah, but, you, said, that, rightmove, has, a, higer, squared, meter, price, than, idealista, Onassis, Nottage, No, Ottavio, Italia, While, the, difference, is, the, city, that, s, all, Onassis, Nottage, That, just, me, testing, the, data, Ottavio, Italia, Then, i, m, confused, Onassis, Nottage, The, abstract, says, that, whatever, is, the, highest, has, a, higher, squared, meter, price, than, whatever, has, the, lowest, Onassis, Nottage, Or, should, I, have, said, London, and, Barcelona, instead, of, Rightmove, and, Idealista, Onassis, Nottage, Media, omitted, Joseph, México, I, still, blocked, from, idealista, Onassis, Nottage, Me, too, Ottavio, Italia, So, you, managed, to, scrape, idealista, Onassis, Nottage, Not, at, all, lmaoo, Onassis, Nottage, I, still, continuing, as, if, I, had, Onassis, Nottage, And, turning, that, in, Ottavio, Italia, Oh, you, just, using, test, data, sorry, i, m, tired, Onassis, Nottage, I, not, using, any, data, Onassis, Nottage, Just, writing, code, Onassis, Nottage, No, idea, if, this, will, work, Ottavio, Italia, Ok, i, will, now, stop, asking, questions, Onassis, Nottage, But, I, wo, have, time, to, think, about, that, since, I, traveling, Onassis, Nottage, Lmaoooo, Onassis, Nottage, Lololol, Ottavio, Italia, I, lost, my, notebook, too, for, some, reason, can, you, post, the, code, for, th, elondon, stuff, where, you, need, to, specify, dd, and, dt, classes, Onassis, Nottage, I, do, nt, have, that, Onassis, Nottage, When, I, was, searching, for, the, file, for, Onassis, Nottage, I, replaced, it, with, the, one, Miguel, updated, Ottavio, Italia, And, how, did, you, gett, the, london, dataframe, Ottavio, Italia, Oh, it, does, nt, have, that, info, Onassis, Nottage, He, has, the, link, to, the, homework, Onassis, Nottage, I, just, connected, to, that, over, again, Onassis, Nottage, Media, omitted, Ottavio, Italia, Ok, maybe, i, m, tired, or, i, m, not, explaining, myself, Onassis, Nottage, Get, some, rest, Onassis, Nottage, I, been, in, meetings, all, day, Onassis, Nottage, I, about, to, call, it, quits, myself, Onassis, Nottage, Onassis, Nottage, The, AWS, Course, I, was, talking, about, Ottavio, Italia, Anyone, else, got, no, idea, on, how, to, do, this, assignment, Joseph, México, No, clue, Onassis, Nottage, Onassis, Nottage, Onassis, Nottage, Onassis, Nottage, UB, DIGITAL, BADGE, Onassis, Nottage, Onassis, Nottage, Media, omitted, Gabriel, Rennó, No, clue, Ottavio, Italia, At, least, we, can, suffer, toghether, Gabriel, Rennó, Got, blocked, by, idealista, too, Gabriel, Rennó, It, was, all, fun, and, games, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, Guys, do, we, have, notebook, from, last, DSF, lecture, it, is, not, uploaded, in, modules, Ottavio, Italia, Unluckily, no, a, few, of, us, also, needs, it, Gabriel, Rennó, I, do, nt, have, it, but, i, managed, the, code, to, extract, the, info, from, the, london, website, Gabriel, Rennó, Is, that, what, you, need, or, sth, else, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, I, was, just, revising, staff, I, was, little, uncomfortable, about, scraping, I, have, not, started, yet, thanks, will, let, you, know, if, something, Gabriel, Rennó, and, how, didi, you, scrappe, ideaist, after, getting, blocked, david, Yes, pls, david, Onassis, did, he, just, used, the, London, info, as, it, was, from, Idealista, Onassis, Nottage, can, you, resend, the, API, and, link, Onassis, Nottage, Got, it, david, At, the, end, he, is, gon, na, delete, the, whole, code, so, he, wo, have, an, error, Ottavio, Italia, Ahahahahah, Onassis, Nottage, That, took, a, minute, Joseph, México, does, he, even, know, Afolabi, david, He, told, us, to, code, so, we, can, learn, but, he, does, even, know, how, to, fix, an, error, Ottavio, Italia, Oh, Ottavio, you, are, too, harsh, he, is, that, bad, Ottavio, Italia, Media, omitted, Joseph, México, now, I, can, see, you, were, right, Ottavio, Italia, Media, omitted, david, I, think, he, did, say, what, the, MinMaxScaler, is, for, Onassis, Nottage, They, called, you, a, madman, Ottavio, Italia, They, sure, did, david, I, did, Ottavio, Italia, Guys, if, we, trained, the, data, that, would, be, the, trained, data, Ottavio, Italia, Ok, ill, stop, david, That, why, I, gave, him, a, in, the, last, poll, Joseph, México, q, how, to, fix, an, error, in, python, a, delete, the, line, david, He, clicking, stop, to, delete, the, results, Andrea, Pavelkova, I, so, confused, david, He, more, than, you, david, He, just, did, it, again, Joseph, México, if, you, have, multiple, errors, just, do, a, for, loop, Joseph, México, for, error, in, jupyter, q, how, to, fix, an, error, in, python, a, delete, the, line, Ottavio, Italia, Efficient, as, always, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, Mamuka, Barnabishvili, Gabriel, Rennó, he, did, nt, I, asked, him, but, he, gave, a, trash, explanation, david, He, said, because, you, need, it, to, train, Onassis, Nottage, are, hilarious, david, He, should, take, some, machine, learning, classes, david, On, kaggle, Andrea, Pavelkova, So, what, he, meant, by, I, need, your, participation, was, actually, I, need, you, to, fix, my, code, for, me, david, That, makes, a, lot, of, sense, Joseph, México, I, need, you, to, learn, along, side, me, Onassis, Nottage, pip, install, Andrea, Andrea, Pavelkova, If, I, was, an, AI, I, would, be, so, happy, Onassis, Nottage, david, Until, now, Andrea, Pavelkova, We, should, run, a, model, to, predict, how, the, next, classes, go, Joseph, México, for, us, un, BCN, feels, like, you, are, in, the, cloud, Cloud, Student, david, Do, take, as, a, fatality, that, I, do, know, how, to, code, Onassis, Nottage, Get, ready, for,

Oh, must, have, missed, it, Gabriel, Rennó, Ruben, Tak, is, anyone, going, to, DDB, tomorrow, because, if, no, one, is, planning, on, going, it, might, be, nice, to, send, him, an, email, that, he,

is, not, for, him, to, show, us, but, for, us, to, go, out, there, experiment, and, find, out, Ottavio, Italia, Yes, I, am, paying, do, that, this, guy, copies, code, and, then, expects, us, to, go, find, out, for, ourselves, Ottavio, Italia, So, Onassis, Nottage, Lmaoooooo, david, Started, to, snow, today, in, Amsterdam, david, Get, your, flight, asap, Onassis, Nottage, Lol, Ottavio, Italia,
